0,OBJECTIVE: To determine if clinically used botulinum exotoxin A (Botox) injections to the forehead and glabellar and crow's-feet regions result in modifications of eyebrow position.,6
1,DESIGN: Prospective study.,17
2,"SETTING: Academic medical center in St Louis, Mo.",17
3,SUBJECTS: Twenty-nine adult patients treated with botulinum exotoxin A injections for rhytids.,8
4,INTERVENTION: The eyebrow position at 13 different sites was measured before injection and 2 weeks after treatment.,18
5,The areas injected were based on patient preference and physician assessment.,11
6,"Of the 29 patients, 14 received injections into the glabella only and 15 received injections into the glabella and forehead, with or without treatment of the crow's-feet.",6
7,"RESULTS: In 29 patients at rest, we found no significant (P value range,.17 to.97) change in eyebrow position, except for a point depression at the right lateral eyebrow.",16
8,"The 15 patients who received injections into the forehead and glabella, with or without treatment of the crow's-feet, had no significant (P value range,.11 to.84) change in eyebrow position, except for a point of depression at the left medial eyebrow.",16
9,Both groups exhibited eyebrow depression in the active state (eyebrow maximally elevated).,16
10,"CONCLUSIONS: Botulinum exotoxin A injections into the forehead and glabellar, and crow's-feet regions did not significantly change the resting eyebrow position.",16
11,"However, forehead injections contributed to eyebrow depression in the active state.",16
12,Inverse psoriasis is a chronic disease frequently treated with topical corticosteroids.,5
13,This retrospective case study evaluated the efficacy of tacrolimus 0.1% ointment to treat inverse psoriasis in children.,7
14,Twelve of 13 patients had complete clearance of their psoriatic lesions within 2 weeks after initiating treatment with topical tacrolimus 0.1%.,7
15,Encephaloceles consist of heterotopic brain tissue that remains connected to the central nervous system.,10
16,"As such, these lesions can occur anywhere along the midline of the head, neck, and back.",10
17,"The clinical findings associated with an encephalocele are often cutaneous, prompting consultation with a dermatologist.",18
18,"Although abnormalities of the skin overlying the spinal cord are readily recognized by our specialty as markers for dysraphism, head and neck lesions may present a diagnostic challenge.",0
19,We describe a case of an anterior encephalocele to increase awareness of this disorder and to emphasize the clinical findings that will assist with diagnosis.,18
20,Our case is of particular interest because of the parasagittal location of the facial nodules and minimal actual midline involvement.,18
21,Nevus comedonicus is a rare developmental defect of the pilosebaceous unit.,10
22,It is also thought to be a variant of epidermal nevus.,10
23,"Previously reported treatments include surgical excision, CO2 laser, dermabrasion, extraction, topical retinoic acid, and numerous topical keratolytics.",5
24,We present a case of a 7-year-old boy with bilateral nevus comedonicus who experienced cosmetic improvement with topical tazarotene and calcipotriene cream.,7
25,This combination represents a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of this cutaneous abnormality.,9
26,Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease with diverse skin manifestations and systemic involvement.,10
27,"We describe an adolescent boy who presented with unilateral scrotal swelling, constitutional symptoms, and a rash.",18
28,Further workup demonstrated lymphadenopathy and pulmonary opacities.,18
29,Granulomas caused by sarcoidosis were identified in biopsy specimens of the epididymis and skin lesions.,18
30,"No acid-fast organisms were found in biopsy specimens, and the patient had negative findings on placement of purified protein derivative (tuberculin).",18
31,The concentration of angiotensin-converting enzyme was not elevated.,18
32,"We discuss pediatric sarcoidosis and, more specifically, intrascrotal sarcoidosis.",10
33,"Mutations in the p63 gene have been identified in five human disorders characterized by varying degrees of limb anomalies, ectodermal dysplasia, and facial clefts.",10
34,"We report a new point mutation in the p63 gene in a family in which the mother was initially diagnosed with Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome and her two offspring manifested ankyloblepharon, ectodermal defects, cleft lip and palate, syndrome.",10
35,"These three patients are the first to be reported with this particular mutation, which consists of a change from glycine to aspartic acid at position 506 on exon 14.",10
36,The clinical spectrum observed in the three family members highlights the wide range of phenotypic variations that result from a single point mutation in the p63 gene.,10
37,"The mother lacks certain features classically associated with AEC, dermatitis of the scalp in particular.",18
38,"Severe erosive dermatitis of the scalp developed in both offspring, along with previously undescribed poikilodermatous skin changes and a deficiency of CD4 T lymphocytes.",10
39,The new and varied phenotypic features noted in these patients emphasize the spectrum of disease caused by mutations in the p63 gene and raise the possibility of a role for it in maintaining immunocompetence.,10
40,BACKGROUND: Keratoelastoidosis marginalis is a rare disease that is a variant of solar elastosis.,10
41,Long-term ultraviolet radiation exposure and chronic trauma secondary to manual labor are considered to be inciting factors.,15
42,OBJECTIVE: To outline the clinical and histological features of this disorder.,17
43,METHODS: We report two cases and review the literature.,17
44,RESULTS: Both patients had persistence of their disease despite multiple topical treatment regimens.,10
45,CONCLUSION: Keratoelastoidosis marginalis is a chronic and progressive disease that is difficult to treat.,10
46,The differential includes focal acral hyperkeratosis and acrokeratoelastoidosis.,18
47,BACKGROUND: Floaters are dislodged pieces of tumor tissue than can obscure Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) frozen sections and confound their interpretation.,10
48,OBJECTIVE: To understand the common causes of floaters and identify management strategies.,5
49,METHODS: An initial virtual consensus conference of Mohs surgeons based on a 60-item questionnaire.,17
50,Data were validated in interviews with randomly selected Mohs surgeons.,17
51,"RESULTS: Based on retrospective reporting of 230 surgeon-years and 170,404 cases of MMS by 26 surgeons, the mean rate of floaters per tumor treated was 1.8%, and the rate of floaters per tissue block was 0.70%.",10
52,Not wiping blades between cuts when a stage is separated into subunits can predispose to floaters.,10
53,"There was also strong consensus that basal cell carcinomas, ulcerated tumors, and tissue from the first stage were more likely to yield floaters.",10
54,"There is little consensus on how to manage floaters, with possibilities including taking additional sections, taking an additional stage, or simply noting the floater.",5
55,CONCLUSION: Floaters are not rare and can complicate MMS margin assessment.,18
56,There is significant expert consensus regarding the causes of floaters and the tissue features that may predispose to them.,10
57,Floaters may be prevented by minimizing their likely causes.,5
58,There is less consensus on what to do with a floater.,19
59,"Mycobacterium avium complex, a common opportunistic pathogen among patients with AIDS, usually manifests as disseminated disease involving the lung, lymph nodes, and gastrointestinal tract.",10
60,"Primary cutaneous infections with M avium complex are extremely rare, and most cutaneous lesions are caused by dissemination.",10
61,"Cutaneous manifestations thus far reported include scaling plaques, crusted ulcers, ecthyma-like lesions, verrucous ulcers, inflammatory nodules, panniculitis, pustular lesions, and draining sinuses.",18
62,Localized skin involvement resembling sporotrichosis is unusual and to our knowledge has been reported only once in the English-language literature.,10
63,We describe an additional case of primary cutaneous M avium complex infection manifesting as sporotrichosis-like lesions on a patient with AIDS.,10
64,"BACKGROUND: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma occurring in the context of posttransplant immunosuppression is rare, with 27 cases documented to date.",16
65,OBSERVATIONS: We report 2 new cases of posttransplant cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients treated at our institution.,16
66,"Both were male recipients of renal transplants who had undergone transplantation a mean of 5.3 years previously and were taking various multidrug immunosuppressive regimens, including cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone.",5
67,"CONCLUSIONS: These cases underscore the association of posttransplant cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with renal transplantation, cyclosporine and tacrolimus therapy, male sex, and later onset compared with B-cell posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease.",16
68,"Relative to the general population, the incidence of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma seems increased among transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive medications.",16
69,Exfoliative erythroderma is a rare presentation of psoriasis in children and adults.,10
70,We report a 9-year-old girl with exfoliative erythroderma secondary to plaque-type psoriasis who developed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression resulting from topical treatment with a medium-potency glucocorticoid.,16
71,"This case emphasizes the need for awareness of this potentially life-threatening complication of topical glucocorticoid use, particularly in patients who have significant compromise of barrier function secondary to widespread skin disease.",16
72,Irritant contact dermatitis of the hands is a significant occupational problem.,10
73,Management primarily involves cessation of exposure to hazardous substances.,5
74,"Protective gloves can reduce or eliminate exposure of the hands to hazardous substances if used correctly, but if not selected and used correctly, protective gloves can actually cause or worsen irritant contact dermatitis of the hands by increasing exposure of the hands to hazardous chemicals.",16
75,We present two cases of occupational irritant contact dermatitis of the hands caused by incorrect use of protective gloves.,16
76,"Glove failure can occur by penetration, permeation, or contamination, and all 3 mechanisms were operative in these cases.",16
77,These cases demonstrate that correct use of gloves is at least as important as selection of gloves made of the appropriate material.,5
78,"By understanding mechanisms of glove failure, clinicians can make more appropriate recommendations for the selection and use of protective gloves in the workplace.",16
79,Triclosan is a common antibacterial chemical currently in widespread use in household and health care-related products.,8
80,"Triclosan was first introduced in 1965 and has been marketed as cloxifenol, Irgasan CH 3565, and Irgasan DP 300.",1
81,"Its most common use is in antimicrobial hand soaps, but in the United States it can also be found in consumer products such as liquid dishwashing soaps, deodorants, and toothpastes.",8
82,The concentrations used in products in the United States typically range from 0.15 to 0.3%.,12
83,"While allergy to triclosan-based products is uncommon, several cases of contact dermatitis secondary to triclosan have been reported.",16
84,"BACKGROUND: Although most commonly encountered in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection, disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is becoming more common in patients receiving immunosuppressive medications.",16
85,"Disseminated MAC with skin lesions may occur, and several presentations have been reported, including panniculitis, cutaneous granulomas, pustules, ulcerations, and erythematous skin lesions.",10
86,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this report is to describe an unusual presentation of MAC that is unlikely to be encountered frequently in the outpatient dermatology setting, especially in a patient without human immunodeficiency virus infection.",16
87,METHODS: The authors present a case of disseminated MAC infection with cutaneous manifestations in an iatrogenically immunocompromised patient.,17
88,CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of MAC infection is challenging given the varied clinical presentations and the difficulty in culturing MAC.,18
89,"In addition, the acid-fast stain is nonspecific.",18
90,"Clinicians should remember to consider MAC infection in patients with acid-fast-positive skin lesions, as the selection of appropriate antibiotic therapy is species specific.",5
91,Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latently infects tumor cells in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL).,10
92,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDAI) could induce apoptosis, with minimal viral replication, in cells latently infected with KSHV.",12
93,"Four HDAI (depsipeptide, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, MS-275, and trichostatin A) were studied in two PEL B cell lines (BCBL-1, BC-3).",17
94,"As expected, histone hyperacetylation was readily induced in all PEL cells exposed to HDAI.",7
95,HDAI also triggered KSHV reactivation in a time- and dose-dependent manner.,12
96,"Flow cytometric and transmission electron microscopic studies, however, revealed that reactivation occurred in only a minor percentage (3-14%) of treated cells.",7
97,"Importantly, and in contrast to viral reactivation, HDAI induced apoptotic cell death in a dose-dependent manner in a large percentage (up to 90%) of KSHV-infected cells.",7
98,"In summary, all four HDAI tested induced histone hyperacetylation in all cells, KSHV reactivation in a minority of cells, and apoptotic cell death in a majority of cells latently infected with KSHV.",12
99,These findings suggest that HDAI may be a therapeutic option for patients with KSHV-mediated diseases by rendering cells infected with KSHV susceptible to apoptosis.,5
100,Hypercoagulable states are inherited or acquired predispositions to venous or arterial thromboses that are best understood in the context of the coagulation cascade.,10
101,"Dermatologists can play a critical role in diagnosing and treating patients with hypercoagulable states because cutaneous symptoms may be a presenting manifestation, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality related to these conditions.",10
102,"This review focuses on the epidemiology and pathophysiology of hypercoagulable states, while the accompanying article iterates the basic clinical features, diagnostic testing, and management of patients who have these conditions.",10
103,Chronic wounds are a major healthcare burden.The practitioner should have an appropriate understanding of both the etiology of the wound as well as the optimal type of dressings to use.,10
104,Fundamental wound characteristics may be used to guide the practitioner's choice of dressings.,5
105,The identification of optimal dressings to use for a particular wound type is an important element in facilitating wound healing.,5
106,Researchers have sought to design wound dressings that aim to optimize each stage in the healing process.,5
107,"In addition, dressings have been designed to target and kill infection-causing bacteria, with the incorporation of antimicrobial agents.",5
108,"Chronic wounds are frequently dynamic in presentation, and the numerous wound dressings available make dressing selection challenging for the practitioner.",5
109,"Choosing the correct dressing decreases time to healing, provides cost-effective care, and improves patient quality of life.",3
110,Research into the mechanisms of wound healing has enhanced our ability to heal chronic wounds at a faster rate through the use of moisture-retentive dressings.,5
111,Newer dressings are incorporating the use of nanotechnology by incorporating miniature electrical sensors into the dressing.,9
112,These dressings are engineered to detect changes in a wound environment and alert the patient or practitioner by altering the color of the dressing or sending a message to a smartphone.,5
113,Additional investigations are underway that incorporate biologic material such as stem cells into dressings.,9
114,BACKGROUND: The 2009 American Joint Committee on Cancer criteria for thin cutaneous melanomas recommend staging sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB) for select stage IB tumors.,18
115,SLNB in this population remains controversial because of low rates of node positivity and inconsistent prognostic parameters.,18
116,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between multiple clinicopathologic features and SLNB result, and clinical outcome.",18
117,METHODS: Clinical and pathologic parameters from patients with melanomas less than or equal to 1.00 mm receiving wide local excision with SLNB at our institution from 2001 through 2010 were recorded.,18
118,Analysis for any statistically significant relationships between recorded parameters and SLN results and outcome were performed.,17
119,RESULTS: A total of 189 cases yielded 3 positive SLNBs (1.6%).,17
120,Disease progression occurred in 6 cases (3.2%).,10
121,Positive SLNB predicted distant metastasis and death from disease (PÂ = .0017).,18
122,Mitotic rate was not associated with a positive SLNB result.,18
123,LIMITATIONS: The follow-up time for this study was limited (meanÂ = 40.7 months).,17
124,CONCLUSION: Our data confirm a statistically significant relationship between SLNB result and likelihood for distant metastasis in thin melanoma.,17
125,There was a trend for a relationship between mitotic rate and clinical outcome.,10
126,This relationship reached statistical significance at a mitotic rate of greater than 3 mitoses/mm(2).,18
127,"Both inherited and acquired hypercoagulable states can present with nonspecific clinical manifestations, such as petechiae, purpura, livedo reticularis, and ulcerations.",10
128,A good history and physical examination are crucial to diagnoses of these conditions.,18
129,"Inherited conditions tend to present either in neonatal period or later in life, while acquired conditions typically occur later in life.",10
130,Diagnostic studies are performed to identify the coagulation cascade deficiency or defect.,10
131,Treatment primarily hinges on anticoagulation and wound care.,5
132,"In this article, we provide an in-depth analysis of the clinical manifestations, diagnostic considerations, and management options of patients in hypercoagulable states.",10
133,Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States and accounts for an estimated 1 million new cases per year.,10
134,"In the white population, the rate of new melanomas diagnosed yearly has more than doubled from 5/100,000 in 1973 to 12/100,000 in 1990.",11
135,The current lifetime risks for white persons are estimated to be 28% to 33% for basal cell carcinoma and 7% to 11% for squamous cell carcinoma.,10
136,"Skin cancer is more common in sun-sensitive, fair-skinned individuals but can occur in any ethnic group, especially with exposure in tropical or sunny climates.",11
137,"Little is known about awareness of skin cancer, risk perception, and performance of skin self-examination (SSE) by people with skin that rarely burns.",10
138,"Our purpose was to evaluate skin cancer awareness, perceptions of skin cancer risk, and performance of SSE in a Hispanic versus non-Hispanic white population with similar access to health care and promotion.",17
139,One hundred forty people employed by a suburban city voluntarily attended a free skin cancer screening and completed a self-administered survey.,11
140,Hispanic individuals reported decreased skin sensitivity and tendency to burn.,11
141,"Non-Hispanic individuals believed they were at greater than average risk for skin cancer, and most Hispanics believed they were at average or below average risk.",11
142,None of the 27 Hispanics reported ever being taught SSE.,11
143,More non-Hispanics (32%) had performed SSE within the last year than Hispanics (15%).,11
144,Regular SSE was associated with a history of skin cancer.,10
145,Multimedia messages usually link skin cancer warning signs and early detection strategies with having sun-sensitive skin.,11
146,"People without sun sensitivity did not perceive themselves as being at risk, did not learn the warning signs of skin cancer, and did not perform SSE.",11
147,"Awareness of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer and perception of risk among Hispanics were less than among non-Hispanics, which may contribute to presentation for care at an advanced stage.",11
148,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of topical nalmefene (SRD174), a long acting opioid antagonist for the management of pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis (AD).",16
149,"DESIGN: Double-blind, vehicle-controlled, randomized, cross-over trial.",17
150,SETTING: Eleven dermatology outpatient clinics in the U.S.,17
151,PATIENTS: Sixty-two out of 136 screened adult subjects with confirmed AD affecting is less than or equal to 20% of body surface area and with moderate-to-severe pruritus.,11
152,INTERVENTIONS: SRD174 cream or matching vehicle cream applied as required during two 7-day periods separated by a wash-out period.,6
153,MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The primary efficacy variable was the period mean of the sum of pruritus intensity difference (SPID) from 0 to 4 hours (SPID0-4) where pruritus was measured on a 0-100 scale Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at seven pre-specified time-points following study drug application.,17
154,"A range of secondary efficacy, safety and tolerance endpoints were included.",17
155,"RESULTS: The LS means for the SPID0-4 (+/- SD) for SRD174 cream and Vehicle were 210.7 (20.4) and 212.1 (20.2), respectively (Difference = -1.3 (95% CI: -25.9, 23.3).",7
156,None of the secondary efficacy endpoints tested demonstrated a statistically significant or clinically important difference between the test product and the vehicle.,7
157,"Overall, the SRD174 cream was well tolerated although there was a higher incidence of AEs when subjects took SRD174 cream (22, 36.7 percent of subjects) compared with when they were taking vehicle (14, 23.3 percent of subjects).",16
158,CONCLUSIONS: SRD174 cream did not demonstrate efficacy in the treatment of pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis raising questions on the role of peripheral opioid receptors as a target for the treatment of pruritus in this population.,7
159,The successful treatment of hand dermatitis (HD) depends less on the selection of the proper topical steroid or a particular systemic agent than on addressing any underlying cause or perpetuating factor.,5
160,"Thus, innovative treatment is based on comprehensively addressing the patient's problem.",5
161,Aggressive approaches may be required for the most severe forms of HD.,5
162,"Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin disease that frequently affects infants and children.",10
163,The worldwide prevalence of atopic dermatitis is estimated to be 5-20% of the pediatric population.,10
164,Studies have shown that atopic dermatitis is associated with considerable economic costs and decreased quality of life.,3
165,"There is no proven curative therapy at present for atopic dermatitis; first-line therapy has generally consisted of dry skin care, avoidance of triggers, application of topical corticosteroids, and administration of histamine H1 receptor antagonists (antihistamines) and oral antibacterials as appropriate.",5
166,"Topical corticosteroids, while effective in many patients, carry the concern of local and systemic adverse effects.",16
167,"As a result, physicians and patients are reluctant to utilize stronger topical corticosteroids in certain areas of the body and for prolonged periods of time.",16
168,The purpose of this article is to review the efficacy and economics of topical calcineurin inhibitors in the treatment of atopic dermatitis.,3
169,This new class of agents (specifically tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream) represents an exciting advance in the treatment of atopic dermatitis.,5
170,Clinical data show that topical calcineurin inhibitors are effective and do not cause the adverse effects associated with topical corticosteroids.,7
171,Several studies have provided evidence that topical calcineurin inhibitors positively affect the quality of life of patients and their caregivers.,7
172,"Compared with branded topical corticosteroids and previous standards of care, topical calcineurin inhibitors appear to be a cost-effective treatment option.",3
173,Drawing comparisons between tacrolimus and pimecrolimus is difficult because definitive head-to-head comparative studies involving these drugs have not been conducted.,2
174,"High-potency topical corticosteroids are very effective for the treatment of psoriasis, but are associated with a number of cutaneous adverse effects.",7
175,Vitamin D modulators have emerged as an important alternative to corticosteroids for the long-term topical treatment of psoriasis.,5
176,Calcitriol 3 microg/g ointment has long been used to treat psoriasis in Europe and is now the only vitamin D3 ointment available for use in the United States (U.S.).,5
177,"Several randomized clinical trials have compared the safety, efficacy, and cosmetic acceptability of calcitriol ointment with other topical psoriasis therapies.",17
178,"In a three-week investigator-blinded study of 25 healthy subjects, calcitriol 3microg/g ointment was associated with markedly less cumulative skin irritation than was calcipotriene ointment.",2
179,"A multicenter, investigator-blinded study of patients with psoriasis found that investigator-rated global improvement of psoriasis symptoms with calcitriol ointment was statistically noninferior to calcipotriene ointment and that calcitriol use produced significantly fewer patients with cutaneous reactions or discomfort.",7
180,A multicenter clinical trial of patients with psoriasis who had lesions affecting sensitive skin areas found that calcitriol use produced less skin irritation than did calcipotriene and was generally preferred to calcipotriene ointment by patients.,2
181,Calcitriol was also significantly more effective for the treatment of psoriasis lesions affecting flexural areas.,7
182,"In another study, patients who received calcitriol ointment exhibited improvement in psoriasis symptoms that was similar to the corticosteroid betamethasone propionate, but were much less likely to have relapsed eight weeks after treatment discontinuation.",7
183,"Two clinical studies also suggested that calcitriol is similar in efficacy to short-contact dithranol, but with a lower incidence of skin irritation and staining.",7
184,"Together, the results of these studies demonstrate that calcitriol 3 microg/g ointment is a significant new option for topical therapy of psoriasis.",5
185,"Calcitriol ointment produces improvement in psoriasis symptoms that is generally similar to the improvement attained with other (except for high potency steroid) topical psoriasis therapies, with a low incidence of adverse events.",7
186,"Financial relationships exist among industry, scientific investigators, and academic medical centers.",17
187,"These relationships can foster research in the basic sciences, clinical trials, health economics evaluations, and other outcomes assessment studies.",17
188,"To govern the conduct of burden-of-illness and outcomes research studies involving collaborations between industry and academia, we propose voluntary standards related to: 1) the development of and adherence to standards for research conduct and reporting; 2) disclosure, discussion, and management of potential impacts of financial conflicts of interest; and 3) transparency in research methods and open access to study results.",17
189,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The classic role of topical and systemic corticosteroids for allergic dermatoses is discussed, with special attention to the impact on the current clinical treatment paradigm by newer systemic and topical therapies.",5
190,These products are reviewed and recommendations presented on how to effectively assimilate them into clinical practice.,17
191,RECENT FINDINGS: Current knowledge about the etiopathogenesis of atopic dermatitis has resulted in drug development focused on agents with less toxicity than current topical and systemic corticosteroids.,5
192,Some agents with ceramide/cholesterol/acid combinations demonstrate efficacy in restoring the dysfunctional skin barrier of atopic patients.,7
193,Concerns resulting from the recent Federal Drug Administration announcement regarding a theoretical risk of cancer associated with topical calcineurin inhibitors are also addressed.,16
194,Novel therapeutic entities are presented.,9
195,SUMMARY: Patients seeking relief from atopic dermatitis have historically had few really effective and safe therapeutic options.,5
196,Topical calcineurin inhibitors represent an exciting new therapy for atopic dermatitis without the side-effect profile associated with topical corticosteroids.,5
197,"Nonsteroidal formulations incorporating glycyrrhetinic acid/telmesteine/Vitis vinifera extract and palmitoylethanolamide as 'active' ingredients recently entered the market, stressing antipruritic, antiinflammatory, and skin barrier repair.",5
198,This confabulates against previously designed topical therapy paradigms.,5
199,These new products may be used as monotherapy or alternatives to steroid agents.,5
200,BACKGROUND: Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor being investigated for psoriasis.,8
201,OBJECTIVES: To determine the 16-week efficacy and safety of two oral tofacitinib doses vs. placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.,7
202,"METHODS: Patients in two similarly designed phase III studies (OPT Pivotal 1, NCT01276639, n = 901; OPT Pivotal 2, NCT01309737, n = 960) were initially randomized 2 : 2 : 1 to tofacitinib 10 or 5 mg or placebo, twice daily.",6
203,Coprimary efficacy end points (week 16) included the proportion of patients achieving Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of 'clear' or 'almost clear' (PGA response) and the proportion achieving â‰¥ 75% reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75).,18
204,"RESULTS: Across OPT Pivotal 1 and OPT Pivotal 2, 745 patients received tofacitinib 5 mg, 741 received tofacitinib 10 mg and 373 received placebo.",6
205,"At week 16, a greater proportion of patients achieved PGA responses with tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg twice daily vs. placebo (OPT Pivotal 1, 41Â·9% and 59Â·2% vs. 9Â·0%; OPT Pivotal 2, 46Â·0% and 59Â·1% vs. 10Â·9%; all P < 0Â·001).",2
206,"Higher PASI 75 rates were observed with tofacitinib vs. placebo (OPT Pivotal 1, 39Â·9%, 59Â·2% and 6Â·2%, respectively, for tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg twice daily and placebo; OPT Pivotal 2, 46Â·0%, 59Â·6% and 11Â·4%; all P < 0Â·001 vs. placebo).",7
207,"Adverse event (AE) rates appeared generally similar across groups; rates of serious AEs, infections, malignancies and discontinuations due to AEs were low.",16
208,Twelve patients reported herpes zoster across the tofacitinib treatment groups in both studies vs. none in the respective placebo groups.,16
209,The most common AE across groups was nasopharyngitis.,16
210,CONCLUSIONS: Oral tofacitinib demonstrated significant efficacy vs. placebo during the initial 16 weeks of treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.,7
211,Safety findings were consistent with prior studies.,16
212,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of dapsone gel 5% in the treatment of acne when used in combination with adapalene gel 0.1%, benzoyl peroxide gel 4% or moisturizer.",7
213,"METHODS: This was a twelve-week, randomized, double-blind study.",17
214,"Patients aged 12 years and older (n=301) applied dapsone gel twice daily and were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of three additional treatments, applied once daily.",17
215,"RESULTS: By week 12, dapsone gel combined with any of the three additional treatments reduced the mean number of inflammatory lesions.",7
216,"However, the authors did not detect a significant difference in the reduction of inflammatory lesions when dapsone was used in combination with adapalene gel or with benzoyl peroxide gel compared to the dapsone plus moisturizer combination group (P=0.052 for both versus moisturizer combination).",2
217,Patients treated with dapsone gel combined with adapalene showed a significantly better response in reduction in non-inflammatory and total acne lesion count than those who received the moisturizer combination.,2
218,Local adverse reactions in all three treatment groups were minimal and generally mild in severity.,16
219,CONCLUSION: Dapsone gel in combination with adapalene gel or benzoyl peroxide gel is safe and well tolerated for the treatment of acne vulgaris.,16
220,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of dapsone gel 5% in the treatment of acne when used in combination with adapalene gel 0.1%, benzoyl peroxide gel 4% or moisturizer.",7
221,"METHODS: This was a twelve-week, randomized, double-blind study.",17
222,"Patients aged 12 years and older (n=301) applied dapsone gel twice daily and were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of three additional treatments, applied once daily.",17
223,"RESULTS: By week 12, dapsone gel combined with any of the three additional treatments reduced the mean number of inflammatory lesions.",7
224,"However, the authors did not detect a significant difference in the reduction of inflammatory lesions when dapsone was used in combination with adapalene gel or with benzoyl peroxide gel compared to the dapsone plus moisturizer combination group (P=0.052 for both versus moisturizer combination).",2
225,Patients treated with dapsone gel combined with adapalene showed a significantly better response in reduction in non-inflammatory and total acne lesion count than those who received the moisturizer combination.,2
226,Local adverse reactions in all three treatment groups were minimal and generally mild in severity.,16
227,CONCLUSION: Dapsone gel in combination with adapalene gel or benzoyl peroxide gel is safe and well tolerated for the treatment of acne vulgaris.,16
228,"BACKGROUND: A novel topical foam formulation of ketoconazole has been developed for use on the scalp, body, and face.",9
229,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of twice-daily treatment with ketoconazole 2% foam for seborrheic dermatitis on the scalp, body, and face.",5
230,"METHODS: One thousand one hundred sixty-two subjects, aged 12 years or older, with mild to severe seborrheic dermatitis were randomized to receive ketoconazole foam (n=427), vehicle foam (n=420), ketoconazole cream (n=210), or vehicle cream (n=105) twice daily for 4 weeks.",17
231,The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving an Investigator's Static Global Assessment score of 0 or 1 at week 4 (treatment success).,17
232,"RESULTS: A significantly greater percentage of subjects achieved treatment success using ketoconazole foam than vehicle foam (56% and 42%, respectively; P<.0001); ketoconazole foam was shown to be equivalent to ketoconazole cream.",2
233,Ketoconazole foam was well-tolerated with a low incidence of treatment-related adverse events (14%; 59/427).,16
234,"CONCLUSION: Ketoconazole foam 2% is a safe, effective, and versatile formulation for use on the scalp, body, and face for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis in patients aged 12 years or older.",5
235,"BACKGROUND: The use of expert opinion is widespread in economic studies of healthcare utilisation; however, few studies have attempted to assess the validity of assumptions derived from such sources.",17
236,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the use of such expert opinion in determining comorbidities associated with atopic dermatitis/eczema (AD/E), which were assessed as part of a recent third-party payer cost-of-illness study.",3
237,"DESIGN: To identify the disease-related comorbidities that would represent costs associated with AD/E, physicians on an expert panel were asked individually and then collectively to group all International Classification of Diseases, 9(th) Edition-Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes as 'most likely', 'possibly' or 'definitely not' related to the costs of identifying and treating patients with AD/E.",3
238,Claims representing $US464 million in payer reimbursements from nearly 125 000 patients with AD/E were identified within two separate claims databases (1997 values).,3
239,Over 850 ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes were identified in the first-listed position from these claims.,17
240,"For each group of 'most likely', 'possibly' and 'definitely not' related diagnosis codes, prevalence rates were compared within AD/E and non-AD/E populations from the two historical payer claims databases.",17
241,Adjusted and non-adjusted odds ratios were calculated by comparing prevalence rates between AD/E and non-AD/E patients in the same payer population.,17
242,RESULTS: The mean prevalence rate of any diagnosis code in the AD/E population was 0.65 +/- 1.82% (SD) with a mean odds ratio of 1.81 +/- 0.96.,10
243,Comorbidities considered by the expert panel 'most likely' to be associated with AD/E had higher prevalence rates (3.28 +/- 3.63%) and odds ratios (2.14 +/- 1.14).,10
244,"Comorbidities considered to be 'possibly' related to AD/E had prevalence rates and odds ratios of 3.01 +/- 5.06% and 1.84 +/- 0.82, respectively.",10
245,Comorbidities considered to be 'definitely not' related to AD/E had the lowest prevalence rates (0.45 +/- 1.09%) and odds ratios (1.80 +/- 0.97).,10
246,CONCLUSIONS: Comparing the result of consensus panels with actual claims histories validated the use of expert opinion in determining comorbidities associated with AD/E.,10
247,Expert opinion yielded valid results in terms of identifying comorbidities that manifested frequently and disproportionately in the AD/E population.,10
248,Limited statistical measurements of comorbidities would have been less specific than expert opinion.,17
249,Future cost-of-illness studies should consider alternative data sources and methodologies to enhance the validity and importance of expert opinion and to corroborate their findings.,3
250,The first formulation of a class of products called topical immuno modulators (TIMS) was approved for clinical use in December 2000 and released in February 2001.,5
251,"This product is tacrolimus in an ointment base, prescribed under the Protopic.",12
252,"The next TIM, pimecrolimus cream, was FDA approved in December 2001 and launched February 2002 in a cream vehicle under the Elidel.",5
253,"TIMs are becoming a significant component in the topical treatment paradigm for atopic dermatitis, introducing a useful alternative to, or complement for, high- and low-potency topical steroid therapy.",5
254,BACKGROUND: Brimonidine tartrate (BT) 0.5% gel demonstrated significantly greater efficacy versus vehicle gel once-daily for the treatment of moderate to severe erythema of rosacea.,2
255,OBJECTIVES: To assess the 30-minute speed of onset of topical BT 0.5% gel in reducing facial erythema in Phase III studies as measured by subject and clinician assessments of erythema.,12
256,"METHODS: Two Phase III, randomized, controlled studies with identical design in which subjects with moderate erythema of rosacea (study A: n=260; study B: n=293) were randomized 1:1 to apply topical BT 0.5% or vehicle gel once-daily for 4 weeks.",17
257,"Evaluations included severity of erythema based on Clinician's Erythema Assessment (CEA) and Patient's Self-Assessment (PSA) prior to study drug application and at 30 minutes after application on days 1, 15, and 29.",18
258,"RESULTS: 97.7% and 96.6% of subjects reported normal study completion for studies A and B, respectively.",17
259,"The percentage of subjects achieving a 1-grade improvement in both CEA and PSA was significantly increased at 30 minutes post-dosing with BT 0.5% gel compared to vehicle gel on visit days (day 1: 27.9 vs 6.9%, P <0.001; day 15: 55.9 vs 21.1%, P <0.001; Day 29: 58.3 vs 32.0%, P <0.001 for BT 0.5% gel vs vehicle) in study A.",2
260,Similar results were shown for study B.,17
261,CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily topical BT gel 0.5% is not only efficacious at reducing facial erythema but also exhibits response within 30 minutes of application in a significant number of patients throughout both Phase III studies.,7
262,Alopecia areata is a form of hair loss believed to be due to an anti-hair-bulb autoimmune process in which CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes affect the peribulb area.,10
263,Alopecia universalis is the most severe form of alopecia areata and manifests itself as a complete loss of all body hair.,10
264,"The authors present the case of a 44-year-old psoriasis patient with a 20-year history of alopecia universalis who failed to respond to etanercept in terms of skin psoriasis and alopecia universalis, while reporting improvement in arthropathy.",7
265,"While tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors succeeded in the treatment of some autoimmune disorders, reports of alopecia areata failures and this one of alopecia universalis demonstrate resistance to such treatment.",5
266,Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors seem to not represent an effective treatment modality for alopecia universalis.,5
267,The understanding gained from this experience should redirect the aims of alopecia areata therapy toward alternate mechanistic interventions.,5
268,BACKGROUND: Intermittent dosing of a topical calcineurin inhibitor for preventing atopic dermatitis (AD) disease relapse in patients with stabilized AD has not been evaluated.,16
269,OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of 3-times-weekly use of tacrolimus ointment in preventing AD disease relapse.,7
270,METHODS: Adult and pediatric patients with moderate to severe AD who were clear of disease after up to 16 weeks of treatment with tacrolimus ointment were randomized in a double-blind fashion to 3-times-weekly treatment with either tacrolimus ointment (0.03% or 0.1%) or vehicle for 40 weeks.,17
271,The primary end point was the number of flare-free treatment days.,17
272,RESULTS: A total of 125 patients were randomized to tacrolimus and 72 patients to vehicle.,17
273,The mean number of flare-free treatment days was 177 for tacrolimus and 134 for vehicle (P = .003).,17
274,Median time to first relapse was 169 days for tacrolimus and 43 for vehicle (P = .037).,17
275,LIMITATIONS: Generalizability to all patients seen in clinic may be limited because only patients who responded to tacrolimus ointment in the stabilization phase were randomized into the maintenance phase of the trial.,17
276,"CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance therapy with tacrolimus ointment was associated with significantly more flare-free days compared with vehicle, and a significantly longer time until first disease relapse.",2
277,Alopecia areata (AA) is non-scarring hair loss resulting from an autoimmune disorder.,10
278,Severity varies from patchy hair loss that often spontaneously resolves to severe and chronic cases that can progress to total loss of scalp and body hair.,10
279,"Many treatments are available; however, the efficacy of these treatments has not been confirmed, especially in severe cases, and relapse rates are high.",7
280,First-line treatment often includes corticosteroids such as intralesional or topical steroids for mild cases and systemic steroids or topical immunotherapy with diphenylcyclopropenone or squaric acid dibutylester in severe cases.,5
281,"Minoxidil and bimatoprost may also be recommended, usually in combination with another treatment.",5
282,Ongoing research and new insights into mechanisms have led to proposals of innovative therapies.,9
283,New directions include biologics targeting immune response as well as lasers and autologous platelet-rich plasma therapy.,9
284,"Preliminary data are encouraging, and it is hoped this research will translate into new options for the treatment of AA in the near future.",9
285,"Psoriasis is a chronic and currently incurable inflammatory skin disease, affecting 2% to 3% of the US population.",10
286,"The cost of care in the United States for hospitalizations, outpatient physician visits, phototherapy, prescription therapies, and over-the-counter medications is estimated to be more than $650 million per year.",2
287,"Guidelines developed by the American Academy of Dermatology in 2009 state that approximately 80% of these patients with psoriasis have mild to moderate disease that can be managed with topical agents, including corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs.",5
288,"Topical vitamin D analogs provide ""steroid-sparing"" effects and a favorable safety profile.",7
289,"Many experts, including a recent consensus conference, classify topical vitamin D agents as first-line therapy for psoriasis either as monotherapy or in combination with topical steroids due to a synergistic, complementary effectiveness.",5
290,Vitamin D analogs are an indispensable component of the current physician's armamentarium for psoriasis treatment.,5
291,"This review, therefore, is oriented to give a comprehensive understanding of this group of drugs and display the available clinical data for each formulation.",5
292,BACKGROUND: The use of light-emitting diode light offers practical advantages in photodynamic therapy (PDT) with topical methyl-aminolevulinate (MAL) for management of actinic keratoses (AK).,5
293,OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the efficacy of MAL PDT using red light-emitting diode light.,7
294,"METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized study.",17
295,"A total of 49 patients with 363 AK lesions had 16.8% MAL cream applied under occlusion for 3 hours, and 47 patients with 360 AK lesions had vehicle cream similarly applied.",11
296,"The lesions were then illuminated (630 nm, light dose 37 J/cm2) with repeated treatment 1 week later.",5
297,Complete lesion and patient (all lesions showing complete response) response rates were evaluated 3 months after last treatment.,17
298,"RESULTS: MAL PDT was superior (P<.0001) to vehicle PDT with respect to lesion complete response (86.2% vs 52.2%, odds ratio 6.9 [95% confidence interval 4.7-10.3]) and patient complete response (59.2% vs 14.9%, odds ratio 13.2 [95% confidence interval 4.1-43.1]).",2
299,LIMITATIONS: The study population may not be representative of all patients with AK.,17
300,CONCLUSION: MAL PDT using red light-emitting diode light is an appropriate treatment alternative for multiple AK lesions.,5
301,BACKGROUND: The approved imiquimod 5% cream regimen for treating actinic keratoses requires a long treatment time and is limited to a small area of skin.,5
302,OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate imiquimod 2.5% and 3.75% for short-course treatment of the full face or balding scalp.,5
303,"METHODS: In two identical studies, adults with 5 to 20 lesions were randomized to placebo, imiquimod 2.5%, or imiquimod 3.75% (1:1:1).",17
304,"Up to two packets (250 mg each) were applied per dose once daily for two 2-week treatment cycles, with a 2-week, no-treatment interval between cycles.",6
305,Efficacy was assessed at 8 weeks posttreatment.,7
306,"RESULTS: A total of 479 patients were randomized to placebo, or imiquimod 2.5% or 3.75%.",17
307,"Complete and partial clearance (> or =75% lesion reduction) rates were 6.3% and 22.6% for placebo, 30.6% and 48.1% for imiquimod 2.5%, and 35.6% and 59.4% for imiquimod 3.75%, respectively (P < .001 vs placebo, each; P = .047, 3.75% vs 2.5% for partial clearance).",2
308,"Median reductions from baseline in lesion counts were 25.0% for placebo, 71.8% for imiquimod 2.5%, and 81.8% for imiquimod 3.75% (P < .001, each active vs placebo; P = .048 3.75% vs 2.5%).",7
309,There were few treatment-related discontinuations.,16
310,"Patient rest period rates were 0% for placebo, 6.9% for imiquimod 2.5%, and 10.6% for imiquimod 3.75%.",17
311,"LIMITATIONS: Local pharmacologic effects of imiquimod, including erythema, may have limited concealment of treatment assignment in some patients.",16
312,CONCLUSIONS: Both imiquimod 2.5% and 3.75% creams were more effective than placebo and were well tolerated when administered daily as a 2-week on/off/on regimen to treat actinic keratoses.,5
313,OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tacrolimus ointment in a large cohort of adult and pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis (AD).,17
314,METHODS: A cohort of 3964 adult and 3959 pediatric patients with AD were enrolled in this open-label noncomparative study.,17
315,Patients applied tacrolimus 0.03% or 0.1% ointment twice daily to the affected areas.,6
316,"Efficacy and safety assessments included percentage of body surface area affected and incidence of adverse events, respectively.",7
317,RESULTS: A total of 7923 patients were evaluated; 95.5% had severe or moderate AD at baseline.,11
318,There was a 52% decrease from baseline in the mean percentage of body surface area affected at month 1 and a 91% decrease at month 18.,7
319,"Two of the most common adverse events, skin burning and pruritus, were generally mild, transient in nature, and decreased in prevalence as AD improved.",16
320,Severity and frequency of other common adverse events were consistent with expected rates in the general population.,16
321,CONCLUSION: Tacrolimus ointment monotherapy in almost 8000 pediatric and adult patients led to continuous improvement in AD and revealed no change in the safety profile reported in previous clinical trials.,7
322,Topical corticosteroids are widely used in the treatment of psoriasis.,8
323,This study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of clobetasol propionate (CP) 0.005% spray to calcipotriene 0.005%-betamethasome diproprionate 0.064% (C-BD) ointment in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.,17
324,"Assessments were made at baseline, week 2, week 4 (end of treatment) and week 8 (4 weeks posttreatment).",17
325,An assessment for Overall Disease Severity (ODS) found that 75% of CP spray-treated patients achieved a rating of clear or almost clear after 4 weeks of treatment compared to 45% of C-BD ointment-treated patients (P=.003).,2
326,Adverse events were reported by less than one-third of patients from each treatment group (31% for CP spray and 33% for C-BD ointment).,16
327,BACKGROUND: Few cost-effectiveness analyses have been conducted on topical therapies for atopic dermatitis.,3
328,OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare cost-effectiveness of high-potency topical corticosteroids (HPTCs) and tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis for patients who are not responsive to or not well controlled with mid-potency topical corticosteroids.,3
329,METHODS: A Markov model represented the cyclic nature of atopic dermatitis.,17
330,Clinical outcomes were derived from published literature.,17
331,"""Efficacy"" was defined as disease-controlled days on which patients experienced a greater than 75% improvement in their disease.",7
332,Resource use and changes in management were on the basis of opinions of a physician panel; secondary treatment was an oral antibiotic with topical corticosteroids.,5
333,Sensitivity analyses were conducted for all variables.,17
334,RESULTS: The model was sensitive to duration of continuous treatment with HPTCs.,7
335,"HPTCs, when limited to 2-week treatment cycles, were associated with the highest total costs ($1682 per year) and the least efficacy (185 disease-controlled days).",3
336,"HPTCs in 4-week treatment intervals and tacrolimus ointment were similar in total costs and efficacy ($1317 vs $1323 for 194 vs 190 disease-controlled days, respectively).",2
337,"Although primary drug costs were higher for patients treated with tacrolimus ointment, patients treated with regimens of HPTCs incurred higher secondary drug costs.",2
338,"CONCLUSION: In the base case analyses, tacrolimus ointment was more cost-effective than HPTCs administered in 2-week treatment cycles, and similar in cost-effectiveness to 4-week cycles of HPTCs.",3
339,A patient with warty dyskeratoma was successfully treated with tazarotenic acid gel.,7
340,We present evidence to support that this did not occur by chance and suggest that tazarotenic acid be investigated further for the treatment of similar dyskeratatic disorders.,5
341,Only a few corticosteroids for topical use have proven safe and effective in pediatric populations down to 3 months of age.,7
342,The authors report the results of a study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of hydrocortisone butyrate (HCB) 0.1% in lipocream (LCr) vehicle in infants and children.,17
343,"A total of 264 boys and girls 3 months to less than 18 years old, with stable, mild to moderate atopic dermatitis affecting at least 10% body surface area applied HCB 0.1% in LCr or LCr alone twice daily for up to 1 month without occlusion.",11
344,Primary end-points included: percent of patients who achieved treatment success based on physician global assessments.,17
345,Secondary endpoint included: difference in pruritus and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) at day 29.,17
346,Treatment was significant (P < 0.001) for HCB 0.1% LCr over vehicle.,5
347,No serious nor significant adverse events were reported.,16
348,Results are representative of a short duration treatment for a chronic disease.,5
349,HCB 0.1% in LCr is more effective than its vehicle in pediatric populations down to 3 months of age without significant adverse events when used twice a day for up to 1 month.,2
350,The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream in adults with moderate atopic dermatitis (AD).,2
351,"A randomized, investigator-blinded, 6-week, multicenter study enrolled patients (> or =16 years) with mild to very severe AD.",17
352,Patients with moderate AD at baseline were analyzed.,17
353,"At study completion, tacrolimus ointment-treated patients had significantly greater improvement in Eczema Area Severity Index score compared with pimecrolimus cream-treated patients (59% versus.",2
354,Significantly more tacrolimus ointment-treated patients than pimecrolimus cream-treated patients improved by 1 or more grades on the Investigators' Global Atopic Dermatitis Assessment (P<.02).,2
355,A total of 5 pimecrolimus cream-treated patients discontinued the study early due to lack of efficacy compared with no tacrolimus ointment-treated patients (P=.02).,2
356,"Overall, reported adverse events occurred at a similar frequency for both treatment groups.",16
357,Tacrolimus ointment is more effective than pimecrolimus cream in the management of adults with moderate AD.,2
358,"OBJECTIVE: Long-term, safe and effective therapeutic options for managing the chronic relapsing nature of atopic dermatitis are essential for improving patient quality of life.",5
359,"To minimize the risks of continued topical corticosteroid usage and potentially reduce the incidence of flares, we tested the efficacy and safety of a rotational paradigm of initial brief application of topical corticosteroid followed by long-term intermittent application of non-steroidal tacrolimus ointment to previously inflamed sites of dermatitis.",16
360,"METHODS: In this 2-phase study, patients who were 2 to 15 years of age and had moderate to severe atopic dermatitis were randomly assigned to 4 days of twice-daily double-blind therapy with either alclometasone ointment 0.05% or tacrolimus ointment 0.03% (Phase I acute), followed by up to 16 weeks of twice-daily open-label tacrolimus ointment 0.03% (Phase I short-term).",17
361,"Patients whose disease stabilized underwent new randomization to double-blind tacrolimus ointment 0.03% or vehicle applied once daily, 3 times per week to clinically normal-appearing skin for up to 40 weeks (Phase II).",17
362,Corticosteroid use was prohibited.,17
363,"RESULTS: Of 206 randomly assigned patients, 152 completed Phase I; 105 of 152 were randomly assigned into Phase II (68 tacrolimus ointment and 37 vehicle).",17
364,There were no differences in adverse events between alclometasone and tacrolimus (Phase I) or between tacrolimus and vehicle (Phase II).,2
365,"In the acute period, alclometasone-treated patients showed greater improvement in atopic dermatitis signs and symptoms; thereafter, when all patients applied tacrolimus ointment (short-term), there were no differences.",7
366,"In Phase II, tacrolimus-treated patients had significantly more disease-free days compared with vehicle, significantly longer time to first relapse, and significantly fewer disease relapse days.",2
367,"CONCLUSIONS: For patients with stabilized moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, long-term intermittent application of tacrolimus ointment to normal-appearing but previously affected skin was significantly more effective than vehicle at maintaining disease stabilization, with a safety profile similar to vehicle.",8
368,BACKGROUND: Many of the eczema cases seen by dermatologists involve the hands.,0
369,"The discomfort and embarrassment of hand dermatitis in any of its forms may compromise a patient's quality of life, causing frustrated attempts to identify the cause of the disease and engendering disappointment with treatment failures.",10
370,"METHODS: The authors assessed the severity scores for each patient, personal and familial histories of atopy, coexisting conditions, triggers of irritation, types of treatments, and their success rates.",18
371,The authors administered a comprehensive survey to 50 consecutive patients presenting with eczematous dermatitis on the ventral aspect of the hands.,17
372,"The authors used a novel hand eczema severity index and a questionnaire that assessed personal and familial histories of atopy as well as coexisting conditions, triggers, and sources of irritation; types of treatments employed; and success rates.",18
373,Patients were also encouraged to complete a composite quality of life assessment.,17
374,"RESULTS: Results reveal a high frequency of personal and familial atopy, a 58% prevalence of contact allergy, a 67.4% history of hay fever, 25.6% cases of asthma, and a 44% incidence of fungal infection, which was one of the most common coexisting conditions.",10
375,CONCLUSIONS: Both topical immunomodulators and topical corticosteroid therapy treatments demonstrated an impressive efficacy.,5
376,An overlap should be considered when clinical symptoms and histological results vacillate between psoriasis and eczema.,10
377,BACKGROUND: MAS063DP (Atopiclair) is a topical cream approved for symptomatic relief in the treatment of atopic and contact dermatitis.,8
378,"METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study in adults with mild-moderate atopic dermatitis.",17
379,Patients were given MAS063DP or vehicle (2:1) three times per day to areas affected by atopic dermatitis for up to 50 days.,6
380,"A patient global assessment change from baseline was determined at days 8, 22, 36, and 50.",17
381,Patient total body pruritus (visual analog scale) and patient opinion on treatment acceptability were also assessed.,17
382,"RESULTS: A total of 218 patients (active: n = 145, vehicle: n = 73) were enrolled.",17
383,"At Day 22, 77% of patients on MAS063DP had a patient global assessment of good improvement or better versus 21% on vehicle (p<0.0001, chi-squared test).",2
384,"Similarly, more patients had improvement in itch over their total body on MAS063DP than on vehicle (p<0.0001).",2
385,CONCLUSION: MAS063DP treatment results in patient-perceived improvements in mild-moderate atopic dermatitis.,7
386,INTRODUCTION: Recent advances in molecular biology have helped establish differences between psoriasis and a group of inflammatory skin disorders commonly referred to as eczema.,10
387,"The authors have observed significant overlap between these two conditions such that a distinction between them may not always be made, even with histologic examination of skin biopsy specimens.",10
388,OBJECTIVE: To determine how frequently psoriasis patients present features of both psoriasis and eczema.,18
389,METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective analysis of 100 consecutive psoriasis patients in their clinic.,17
390,"RESULTS: The authors found that 20% could be diagnosed as ""intermediate,"" having lesions with characteristics of both psoriasis and eczema, or a personal history of both.",18
391,"The authors suggest naming this category of inflammatory dermatosis ""PsEma""--an overlap condition in which the clinical, histologic, molecular, biologic, and therapeutic responses show characteristics of both psoriasis and eczema.",10
392,OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus ointment 0.1% and pimecrolimus cream 1% in adult patients with moderate to very severe atopic dermatitis (AD).,7
393,"METHODS: A total of 281 patients (141 treated with tacrolimus and 140 treated with pimecrolimus) were randomized to a multicenter, investigator-blinded, 6-week study.",17
394,"RESULTS: Tacrolimus-treated patients had significantly greater improvements in the Eczema Area Severity Index score compared with pimecrolimus-treated patients (mean percent reduction from baseline to study end: 57% vs 39%, respectively; p=0.0002).",2
395,"Treatment success was also significantly greater among the tacrolimus-treated patients compared with pimecrolimus-treated patients (40% vs 22% at study end; p=0.001), as was the improvement in percentage of total body surface area affected (a reduction of 49% vs 34% at study end; p=0.01).",2
396,Both treatment groups had similar improvements in patient assessment of itch.,7
397,"There were no significant differences in the incidences of adverse events, including application-site burning and application-site pruritus, the two most commonly reported adverse events.",16
398,"Significantly more pimecrolimus-treated patients than tacrolimus-treated patients withdrew from the study due to lack of efficacy (10 vs 1, p=0.005).",2
399,CONCLUSION: Tacrolimus ointment is more effective than pimecrolimus cream in adults with moderate to very severe AD.,7
400,Both agents have a similar safety profile.,16
401,BACKGROUND: MAS063DP cream has received marketing authorization in the US and the European Union for symptom relief of atopic dermatitis (eczema) and contact dermatitis.,8
402,"DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized, vehicle-controlled, phase IV study was completed in the US.",17
403,METHODS: 218 patients aged 18 to 84 years joined this 50-day study.,11
404,Patients self-administered MAS063DP cream (N=145) or vehicle cream (N=73) 3 times per day to affected areas and those areas prone to be affected.,6
405,"The primary endpoint for efficacy was the change in EASI at Day 22 of treatment, comparing the 2 treatment groups.",17
406,"Secondary outcomes included EASI scores at other time points, IGA, pruritus (100mm VAS), % BSA, and the need for rescue medication.",17
407,RESULTS: MAS063DP was statistically (p<.0001) more effective than vehicle in all outcomes at all time points.,2
408,The incidence of rash was 2.1% in the MAS063DP group versus 5.5% in the vehicle group.,2
409,Only 2 patients discontinued MAS063DP due to an adverse event.,16
410,CONCLUSION: MAS063DP cream was confirmed to be a safe and effective treatment for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in adults.,8
411,"Atopic dermatitis is a common, chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin disease frequently affecting infants and children.",10
412,The worldwide prevalence of atopic dermatitis is estimated to be 5--20% of the paediatric population.,10
413,"First-line therapy has generally consisted of dry skin care, avoidance of triggers, application of topical corticosteroids, and administration of antihistamines and oral antibacterials.",5
414,"Topical corticosteroids improve the lesions of atopic dermatitis; however, concern on the part of physicians and patients regarding adverse effects has led to reluctance to utilise topical corticosteroids early and especially for prolonged periods.",7
415,"Topical immunomodulators (TIMs), including tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream, were recently introduced for the treatment of atopic dermatitis.",8
416,"Clinical data show that TIMs are effective in atopic dermatitis, yet do not cause the significant adverse effects associated with topical corticosteroids.",7
417,"Questions remain regarding the place of TIMs as a treatment for atopic dermatitis and how to use them most effectively, from both therapeutic and pharmacoeconomic standpoints.",19
418,"Specifically, two major issues remain unresolved: (i) how TIMs measure up to other therapies, especially topical corticosteroids; and (ii) how members of the TIM drug class compare against each other.",19
419,Previous research has established that atopic dermatitis has a significant impact on quality of life (QOL) and carries a substantial economic burden.,3
420,Some studies have also measured the utility of various atopic dermatitis disease states.,17
421,"While there is a need for further research, early economic studies provide evidence that TIMs positively affect the QOL of patients and families.",7
422,"In certain patients, TIMs may be cost effective and have an acceptable incremental cost utility compared with topical corticosteroids.Making cost-effectiveness comparisons between tacrolimus and pimecrolimus is challenging because there are limited head-to-head comparative data.",2
423,"Given currently available efficacy data, the results of one study suggest that tacrolimus may be more cost effective than pimecrolimus in paediatric patients with moderate atopic dermatitis.",2
424,The full economic and QOL benefits of both agents are yet to be completely understood.,19
425,"The studies reviewed herein are the first to delineate the pharmacoeconomic benefits of TIMs in atopic dermatitis, and lay the foundation for future analyses.",7
426,TIMs represent an exciting advance in the treatment of atopic dermatitis.,8
427,Additional research will help determine the proper place of TIMs among the current array of therapeutic options for atopic dermatitis.,5
428,Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a persistent and pervasive condition that affects men worldwide.,10
429,"Some common treatment options for AGA include hair prosthetics, oral and topical medications, and surgical hair restoration (SHR).",5
430,Pharmaceutical and SHR treatments are associated with limitations including adverse side effects and significant financial burden.,16
431,Low-level laser or light (LLL) devices offer alternative treatment options that are not typically associated with adverse side effects or significant costs.,5
432,There are clinic- and home-based LLL devices.,5
433,"One home-based laser comb device has set a standard for others; however, this device requires time devoted to carefully moving the comb through the hair to allow laser penetration to the scalp.",5
434,A novel helmet-like LLL device for hair growth has proven effective in preliminary trials and allows for hands-free use.,7
435,"Regardless, there are few clinical trials that have been conducted regarding LLL devices for AGA and results are mixed.",17
436,Further research is required to establish the true efficacy of these devices for hair growth in comparison to existing alternative therapies.,19
437,Detailed visualization of the skin in the practice of dermatology is key to a comprehensive examination and accurate diagnosis.,18
438,"Advancements in digital dermoscopy, microscopy, imaging and photography have formed an impressive arsenal with which dermatologists can offer state-of-the-art patient care while streamlining their clinical practice and improving their academic and research capacities.",18
439,"Many types of advanced imaging are used in the biologic sciences at the bench; however, our paper reviews the clinical, noninvasive in vivo human applications of these emerging technologies.",18
440,"Topical retinoids offer highly effective treatment for both inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne, with tazarotene demonstrating greater efficacy than other topical retinoids.",7
441,"A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trial has been performed to evaluate whether the adjunctive use of clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide could enhance the efficacy of tazarotene still further.",17
442,Patients with moderate to severe inflammatory acne applied tazarotene 0.1% cream each evening and were randomly assigned to morning applications of vehicle gel or a ready-to-dispense formulation of clindamycin 1%/benzoyl peroxide 5 % gel containing 2 emollients.,17
443,"Tazarotene/clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide achieved a significantly greater reduction in comedo count than tazarotene monotherapy and, among patients with a baseline papule plus pustule count of > or =25 (the median value), a significantly greater reduction in inflammatory lesion count.",2
444,The combination therapy was also at least as well-tolerated as tazarotene monotherapy.,16
445,The adjunctive use of clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide gel with tazarotene cream promotes greater efficacy and may also enhance tolerability.,7
446,Any improvements in tolerability could be due to the emollients in the clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide gel formulation.,16
447,BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis/eczema (AD/E) is a common disease.,10
448,Few studies have attempted to quantify the cost to third-party payers.,3
449,OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to identify the annual cost of medical services and prescription drugs for the treatment of AD/E to private insurance and Medicaid payers in the United States.,3
450,METHODS: We used a retrospective study design employing claims data from 1997 and 1998 from a private insurer and a state Medicaid program to analyze costs incurred.,17
451,"Beneficiaries were considered to have AD/E if they had at least one claim in 1997 with a primary or secondary listing of 1 of 3 diagnosis codes: 691.8, other atopic dermatitis and related conditions; 692.9, contact dermatitis and other eczema when no cause is specified; or 373.3, noninfectious dermatoses of eyelid.",10
452,Patients who did not meet the diagnosis criteria served as a control group in each payer for comparisons of expenditures with the AD/E group.,11
453,"RESULTS: Disease prevalence was 2.4% (private insurer) to 2.6% (Medicaid) of all eligible beneficiaries, and 3.5% to 4.1% of patients submitted at least one health care claim during the study period.",3
454,Medicaid-insured patients used outpatient hospital visits and hospitalizations at a greater rate than did privately insured patients; neither used emergency departments extensively.,2
455,The third-party payer cost of illness for AD/E ranged from $0.9 billion to $3.8 billion when projected across the total number of persons younger than 65 years insured by private insurers and Medicaid in the United States.,3
456,More than one fourth of all health care costs for patients with AD/E may be attributed to AD/E and co-morbid conditions.,3
457,"CONCLUSIONS: Annual costs of AD/E are similar to those of other diseases such as emphysema, psoriasis, and epilepsy.",3
458,Patients incur significant costs associated with AD/E and co-morbid conditions.,3
459,"Successful management of atopic dermatitis requires a multipronged approach that includes skin barrier function care, use of topical or systemic agents, and identification and elimination of precipitating or exacerbating factors.",5
460,"Because the origin of atopic dermatitis is multifactorial and trigger factors differ among patients, treatment plans must be specific to the individual patient.",5
461,"This article offers an example of a permutational, or flexible, treatment paradigm.",5
462,"The approach utilizes 4 topical regimens--high-potency topical corticosteroids, lowest effective potency topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), or topical corticosteroid/TCI combinations--as initial therapy in a variety of induction protocols, as determined by the severity of a patient's condition and history.",5
463,The paradigm permits treatment to progress from a chosen induction therapy to maintenance therapy.,5
464,"During the patient's induction therapy, as soon as an acceptable level of clearance is achieved, therapy should be adjusted to a maintenance regimen, such as monotherapy with either a TCI or a lowest effective potency topical corticosteroid (the latter used intermittently) or an alternation of the two agents.",5
465,"If there is no clearance or positive response with the initial induction protocol, the clinician should move to one of the alternative regimens.",5
466,"As the pathogenesis of psoriasis is better understood, specific targeted therapies are being developed.",10
467,"In addition to alefacept, etanercept, efaluzimab, and infliximab, discussed in separate articles in this issue, numerous other investigational therapies are currently in clinical trials, some of which will likely be approved in the future.",17
468,We review the most promising of these therapies and their mechanisms of action.,5
469,BACKGROUND: Nanoscale technology is rapidly being incorporated into medicine.,9
470,Nanodermatology concentrates on the use of nanomaterials (sized less than 1000 nm) on the skin.,9
471,This article gives basic descriptions of various nanomaterials currently used in dermatology.,9
472,METHODS: Studies retrievable through PubMed and other relevant literature from the nanotechnology industry pertaining to the use of nanoparticles in dermatology are reviewed.,17
473,The authors provide their insight into potential applications for skin conditions.,8
474,"RESULTS: Nanotechnology-based products and technology have a promising, inevitable future in medicine particularly in dermatology, such as prevention of disease, treatment, and imaging with less invasiveness.",9
475,"CONCLUSIONS: The advent of nanoparticles including nanostructured lipid particles and solid lipid nanoparticles, dendrimers, and quantum dots have already many cosmetic applications as well as great potential in dermatologic applications.",9
476,The DermLite II is an improvement on a previous instrument allowing for dermoscopy to be carried out without the need of immersion oil.,18
477,It consists of a magnifying lens encircled by light-emitting diodes that can be adjusted for polarization or can be customized by the manufacturer to produce colors of specific wavelengths for visualizing pigmentation and structures of various dermal depths.,18
478,"This new version of the DermLite makes it very convenient for the evaluation of not just pigmented lesions, but nonpigmented skin cancers, scalp disease, and vascular patterns.",18
479,It can be attached to a camera to record images and has a retractable faceplate for use with immersion oil.,18
480,Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a potent inflammatory cytokine that plays a central role in the innate immune response.,10
481,"IL-1 mediates the acute phase of inflammation by inducing local and systemic responses, such as pain sensitivity, fever, vasodilation, and hypotension.",10
482,"It also promotes the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells, which allows the infiltration of inflammatory and immunocompetent cells into the tissues.",10
483,"The release of IL-1 from the epidermis after activation is a primary event that promotes inflammatory skin conditions through the induction of various cytokines, proinflammatory mediators, and adhesion molecules.",10
484,BACKGROUND: Topical calcipotriene is frequently prescribed for the treatment of plaque-type psoriasis.,8
485,"Calcipotriene is currently available in the US as an ointment, a solution, a cream, and in a fixed-dose combination ointment with betamethasone dipropionate.",6
486,Calcipotriene 0.005% has recently been formulated as a foam using a novel aqueous-based formulation to provide a new topical treatment option for patients with psoriasis.,9
487,OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical calcipotriene 0.005% foam for the treatment of mild to moderate plaque-type psoriasis.,7
488,"DESIGN: Two identical, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, 8-week phase III clinical trials.",17
489,"INTERVENTION: Subjects with plaque-type psoriasis affecting 2-20% of the body surface area, with an identifiable target lesion affecting the trunk or extremities, were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to calcipotriene foam (n = 437) or vehicle foam (n = 222).",11
490,Study medication was applied twice daily for 8 weeks.,6
491,OUTCOME MEASURES: Treatment success was defined as a score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear) on the Investigator's Static Global Assessment (ISGA) psoriasis rating scale and a minimum improvement of ISGA score of at least 2 grades from baseline.,17
492,"Predefined target lesions were assessed for erythema, scaling, and plaque thickness.",17
493,"Primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects in each treatment group who achieved treatment success after 8 weeks, analyzed on an intent-to-treat (ITT) basis.",5
494,"In the primary endpoint analysis, subjects missing 8-week outcomes data were classified as treatment failures regardless of their outcomes at earlier evaluations.",17
495,"As part of the sensitivity analysis, a last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) approach to impute missing 8-week efficacy outcomes also examined treatment.",17
496,"Secondary endpoints included treatment success as a function of baseline ISGA score (mild or moderate), ISGA score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear), and effects of treatment on target lesion.",5
497,Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study.,17
498,"RESULTS: In the ITT population of Study 1, treatment success after 8 weeks was achieved by 14% of subjects in the calcipotriene foam group versus 7% of subjects in the vehicle foam group (p = 0.058).",2
499,"In the LOCF analysis, treatment success was achieved by more subjects with calcipotriene foam than with vehicle foam (15% vs 7%; p = 0.034).",2
500,"In Study 2, treatment success was achieved by more subjects in the calcipotriene foam group for the primary endpoint (27% vs 16%; p = 0.016) and the LOCF analysis (28% vs 16%; p = 0.010).",7
501,Subjects in the calcipotriene foam group exhibited better response rates than did the vehicle foam group for most of the secondary outcomes.,2
502,Calcipotriene foam was safe with an overall incidence of AEs similar to those experienced in the vehicle foam group.,16
503,Application-site reactions were noted in approximately 1-2% of subjects in each group.,16
504,No AE was reported in more than 2% of subjects in the calcipotriene foam group.,16
505,Treatment was discontinued because of AEs in approximately 2% of subjects in both groups.,16
506,"CONCLUSIONS: In two identically designed, phase III clinical trials, calcipotriene 0.005% foam was safe and effective for the treatment of mild to moderate plaque-type psoriasis for up to 8 weeks.",7
507,CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00688519 and NCT00689481.,17
508,BACKGROUND: Ixekizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody against the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 17A.,12
509,We report two studies of ixekizumab compared with placebo or etanercept to assess the safety and efficacy of specifically targeting interleukin 17A in patients with widespread moderate-to-severe psoriasis.,2
510,"METHODS: In two prospective, double-blind, multicentre, phase 3 studies (UNCOVER-2 and UNCOVER-3), eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had a confirmed diagnosis of chronic plaque psoriasis at least 6 months before baseline (randomisation), 10% or greater body-surface area involvement at both screening and baseline visits, at least a moderate clinical severity as measured by a static physician global assessment (sPGA) score of 3 or more, and a psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score of 12.",17
511,"Participants were randomly assigned (1:2:2:2) by computer-generated random sequence with an interactive voice response system to receive subcutaneous placebo, etanercept (50 mg twice weekly), or one injection of 80 mg ixekizumab every 2 weeks, or every 4 weeks after a 160 mg starting dose.",17
512,Blinding was maintained with a double-dummy design.,17
513,Coprimary efficacy endpoints were proportions of patients achieving sPGA score 0 or 1 and 75% or greater improvement in PASI at week 12.,17
514,Analysis was by intention to treat.,17
515,"These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01597245 and NCT01646177.",17
516,"FINDINGS: Between May 30, 2012, and Dec 30, 2013, 1224 patients in UNCOVER-2 were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous placebo (n=168), etanercept (n=358), or ixekizumab every 2 weeks (n=351) or every 4 weeks (n=347); between Aug 11, 2012, and Feb 27, 2014, 1346 patients in UNCOVER-3 were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=193), etanercept (n=382), ixekizumab every 2 weeks (n=385), or ixekizumab every 4 weeks (n=386).",17
517,"At week 12, both primary endpoints were met in both studies.",7
518,"For UNCOVER-2 and UNCOVER-3 respectively, in the ixekizumab every 2 weeks group, PASI 75 was achieved by 315 (response rate 89Â·7%; [effect size 87Â·4% (97Â·5% CI 82Â·9-91Â·8) vs placebo; 48Â·1% (41Â·2-55Â·0) vs etanercept]) and 336 (87Â·3%; [80Â·0% (74Â·4-85Â·7) vs placebo; 33Â·9% (27Â·0-40Â·7) vs etanercept]) patients; in the ixekizumab every 4 weeks group, by 269 (77Â·5%; [75Â·1% (69Â·5-80Â·8) vs placebo; 35Â·9% (28Â·2-43Â·6) vs etanercept]) and 325 (84Â·2%; [76Â·9% (71Â·0-82Â·8) vs placebo; 30Â·8% (23Â·7-37Â·9) vs etanercept]) patients; in the placebo group, by four (2Â·4%) and 14 (7Â·3%) patients; and in the etanercept group by 149 (41Â·6%) and 204 (53Â·4%) patients (all p<0Â·0001 vs placebo or etanercept).",2
519,"In the ixekizumab every 2 weeks group, sPGA 0/1 was achieved by 292 (response rate 83Â·2%; [effect size 80Â·8% (97Â·5% CI 75Â·6-86Â·0) vs placebo; 47Â·2% (39Â·9-54Â·4) vs etanercept]) and 310 (80Â·5%; [73Â·8% (67Â·7-79Â·9) vs placebo; 38Â·9% (31Â·7-46Â·1) vs etanercept]) patients; in the ixekizumab every 4 weeks group by 253 (72Â·9%; [70Â·5% (64Â·6-76Â·5) vs placebo; 36Â·9% (29Â·1-44Â·7) vs etanercept]) and 291 (75Â·4%; [68Â·7% (62Â·3-75Â·0) vs placebo; 33Â·8% (26Â·3-41Â·3) vs etanercept]) patients; in the placebo group by four (2Â·4%) and 13 (6Â·7%) patients; and in the etanercept group by 129 (36Â·0%) and 159 (41Â·6%) patients (all p<0Â·0001 vs placebo or etanercept).",2
520,"In combined studies, serious adverse events were reported in 14 (1Â·9%) of 734 patients given ixekizumab every 2 weeks, 14 (1Â·9%) of 729 given ixekizumab every 4 weeks, seven (1Â·9%) of 360 given placebo, and 14 (1Â·9%) of 739 given etanercept; no deaths were noted.",16
521,INTERPRETATION: Both ixekizumab dose regimens had greater efficacy than placebo and etanercept over 12 weeks in two independent studies.,2
522,These studies show that selectively neutralising interleukin 17A with a high affinity antibody potentially gives patients with psoriasis a new and effective biological therapy option.,12
523,Autoinflammatory syndromes and diseases are a group of disorders of innate immunity.,10
524,This group has grown rapidly in recent years as a result of research advancements in molecular biology and genetics.,17
525,These diseases often present with skin manifestations and the dermatologist may not recognize the constellation of symptoms and medical history as a systemic inflammatory disease.,18
526,Dermatologists would benefit from a deeper understanding of these diseases and the new treatments available for them.,13
527,Only a few corticosteroids for topical use have been proven safe and effective in pediatric populations down to 3 months of age.,7
528,The authors examined the systemic safety (adrenal suppression potential) of topically applied hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% cream (proprietary lipid rich cream vehicle) in the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients aged 3 months to 6 years and 12 years to 18 years.,5
529,An open-label hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression study was conducted wherein the sole treatment was 0.1% proprietary lipid rich cream vehicle.,17
530,A total of 65 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and body surface area involvement of at least 25% were included in the treatment phase of the study based on the requirement that these patients had normal baseline cortisol and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system function.,17
531,All signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis showed progressive improvement beginning with day 8 through the day 29 evaluation.,7
532,"Pruritus showed the greatest improvement, with a decrease in grade of 1.3 at day 8, and continued to show improvement at day 29, with a decrease of 1.8 from baseline.",7
533,"The percent body surface area affected at baseline averaged 40.5%, and it decreased significantly to a mean of 6.5% at day 29.",7
534,Only 5 (8%) of the 63 patients showed laboratory evidence of adrenal suppression at the end of the treatment evaluation.,16
535,None of these ever demonstrated any clinical signs or symptoms of adrenal suppression.,16
536,"This study adds hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% cream, to the short list of corticosteroids that have been proven effective and safe by the cosyntropin suppression test in children 3 months and older with widespread atopic dermatitis.",7
537,"Cryosurgery is a therapeutic modality useful for treating cutaneous benign, premalignant, and malignant lesions.",5
538,It consists of lowering lesional temperature below a critical level to cause its destruction.,12
539,"Lowering skin temperatures without the intent to directly cause lesional destruction (to trigger an immune mechanism, for example) is termed cryotherapy.",12
540,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is commonly associated with immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody-related mechanisms, which are the focus of this article.",10
541,"The vast majority of patients with AD exhibit hyperproduction of IgE, particularly during disease onset or flare.",10
542,IgE-dependent late-phase reactions may influence the chronic inflammatory response in AD.,10
543,"Clearly, genetics plays a major role in determining who develops AD.",10
544,"However, the recent increase in AD prevalence suggests that a complex interaction between environmental factors and susceptibility genes results in clinical expression of the disorder.",10
545,"These immunologic ""triggers"" differ among individuals and include various foods, airborne allergens, irritants and contactants, hormones, stress, climate, and microorganisms.",15
546,"Although much about AD remains to be elucidated, our current understanding of its pathophysiology has provided clinicians with the ability to construct more rational therapeutic interventions, including multiple-agent regimens that provide both immediate relief and effective long-term management.",5
547,Future advances will come from identification of the genes causing this disease and further elucidation of the immunoregulatory mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AD.,10
548,BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is often treated with immunomodulatory therapies that can affect the immune response to common antigens.,5
549,Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor.,12
550,OBJECTIVE: To characterize the effect of long-term exposure to tofacitinib 10Â mg twice daily on T-cell function in psoriasis patients.,5
551,METHODS: Patients completing at least 3Â months' continuous treatment with tofacitinib 10Â mg twice daily were vaccinated with T-cell-dependent vaccines (monovalent tetanus toxoid and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate [PCV-13]).,17
552,Patients were assessed at baseline (before vaccination) and then again 4Â weeks after vaccination.,17
553,"For PCV-13, we evaluated serotype-specific, opsonophagocytic antibody responses, and for tetanus toxoid, we evaluated humoral responses.",12
554,"RESULTS: Among 60 patients who completed the study, the geometric mean fold rise from baseline for the 13 PCV serotypes at 4Â weeks postvaccination varied from 8.3 (serotype 3) to 101.9 (serotype 6A).",17
555,Similar results were observed for patients with and without lymphopenia at baseline.,11
556,"For tetanus toxoid, 51 (88%) patients had â‰¥2-fold and 35 (60%) patients had â‰¥4-fold rise in antibody concentration.",7
557,LIMITATIONS: There was no placebo control.,17
558,CONCLUSION: Most psoriasis patients who receive tofacitinib can mount satisfactory T-cell-dependent responses to PCV-13 and tetanus vaccines.,7
559,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) increases health care utilization, affects patient quality of life, places a burden on caregivers, decreases patient/parent productivity, and adds to health care costs.",3
560,Few studies have examined the effect of specific treatment modalities across a variety of AD-related outcomes.,10
561,"This prospective, multicenter, open-label longitudinal study of adult and pediatric patients with moderate to severe AD was conducted to evaluate the effect of a specific therapeutic intervention on AD-related outcomes over a period of 6 months.",17
562,"Surveys collected physician clinical assessments and patient- and caregiver-reported data across the following domains: clinical outcome, health care utilization/costs, quality of life, physical appearance, productivity/absenteeism, and medication compliance.",17
563,This study is intended to help guide future research efforts on the net costs and benefits of different interventions across a diverse set of domains and in larger populations.,17
564,INTRODUCTION: ESPRIT (NCT00799877) is an ongoing 10-year international prospective observational registry evaluating the long-term safety and effectiveness of originator adalimumab in routine clinical practice for adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis.,17
565,"Herein, we report the long-term safety, effectiveness, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) following adalimumab treatment over the first 7Â years of the ESPRIT registry.",7
566,METHODS: All treatment-emergent (All-TE) adverse events (AE) since the initial (first ever) dose of adalimumab were assessed.,16
567,Physician Global Assessment (PGA) and PROs (PROs for US patients only) were evaluated during registry participation.,17
568,"RESULTS: As of 30 November 2015, 6051 patients in the ESPRIT registry were analyzed, representing 23,660.1 patient-years (PY) of overall adalimumab exposure.",17
569,"The incidence rates for All-TE serious AEs, serious infections, and malignancies were 4.4, 1.0, and 1.0 events per 100 PY (E/100PY), respectively.",16
570,The standardized mortality ratio for TE deaths in the registry was 0.27 (95% CI 0.18-0.38).,16
571,"During the registry's first 7Â years, PGA ""clear"" or ""minimal"" was achieved by >50% of patients at each annual visit, and among US patients, the mean improvement from baseline in different PROs was maintained.",7
572,"CONCLUSION: No new safety signals were identified during the first 7Â years of the registry, and safety was consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab.",16
573,The number of TE deaths was below the expected rate.,16
574,"During the registry's first 7Â years, most of the patients remained free of All-TE cardiovascular events, serious infections, and malignancy.",16
575,As-observed effectiveness of adalimumab and improvements from baseline in PROs were maintained through 7Â years of registry participation.,7
576,"TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT00799877.",17
577,OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and histologic manifestations of skin reactions incidentally noted in patients with stage IV melanoma who were treated with up to 9 mg/kg of a humanized monoclonal antibody reactive against human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (anti-CTLA-4) as a single agent every 3 weeks.,6
578,SETTING: Single-institution prospective study.,17
579,DESIGN: Patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 as a sole agent were prospectively referred for clinicopathologic characterization of skin reactions occurring during treatment.,16
580,"MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Specific clinicopathologic features were determined by means of a detailed history, a physical examination, conventional histologic analysis, antibody staining, and complete blood cell counts.",18
581,RESULTS: Nine (14%) of 63 consecutive patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 as a sole agent developed skin eruptions that were attributed to anti-CTLA-4 in 8 of them.,16
582,"Skin lesions consisted primarily of discrete, pruritic, erythematous, minimally scaly papules that typically coalesced into thin plaques on the trunk and extensor surfaces of the extremities.",18
583,Extensive alopecia was also noted in 1 patient.,18
584,"Histologically, a superficial, perivascular CD4+-predominant T-cell infiltrate with eosinophils in the dermis, rare dyskeratotic cells, and mild epidermal spongiosis were present.",10
585,An increase (compared with pretreatment values) in the peripheral blood eosinophil frequency was observed in patients at the time of skin eruptions (P = .006).,18
586,CONCLUSIONS: Specific features of the skin eruption dermatitis with increased tissue and peripheral blood eosinophil levels in a subset of treated patients.,16
587,Specific features of skin eruption associated with anti-CTLA-4 resemble those described for maculopapular reactions to medications.,16
588,"CCL21, a lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC)-derived chemokine, and its receptor CCR7 regulate dendritic cell (DC) trafficking to lymph nodes (LN), but it is unclear how CCL21 expression is regulated.",12
589,Oncostatin M (OSM) is an IL-6-like cytokine synthesized by activated DC and other leukocytes.,12
590,"In vitro, OSM (but not TNF-alpha) stimulated CCL21 mRNA and protein expression by human dermal microvascular EC (DMEC) in an ERK1/2-dependent fashion.",12
591,Conditioned medium from OSM-treated DMEC stimulated CCL21-dependent chemotaxis of mouse bone marrow-derived DC (BMDC).,12
592,"Cultured BMDC expressed OSM, which was increased with the addition of LPS.",17
593,"Topical application of the contact-sensitizing hapten, trinitrochlorobenzene, resulted in enhanced OSM expression in the skin, whereas cutaneous injection of TNF-alpha did not.",2
594,Injection of OSM into the footpad increased CCL21 mRNA expression in the draining LN by approximately 10-fold and in mouse skin by approximately 4-fold without increasing CCR7 mRNA.,7
595,"In vitro, OSM increased the permeability of DMEC and lung microvascular EC monolayers to FITC-dextran beads, and, in vivo, it enhanced accumulation of Evans blue dye in draining LN by approximately 3-fold (p = 0.0291).",7
596,"Of note, OSM increased trafficking of BMDC injected in footpads to draining LN by 2-fold (p = 0.016).",7
597,"In summary, OSM up-regulates CCL21 expression in skin and draining regional LN.",12
598,"We propose that OSM is a regulator of CCL21 expression and endothelial permeability in skin, contributing to efficient migration of DC to regional LN.",12
599,BACKGROUND: Acquired melanocytic proliferations (AMPs) are excised throughout the year.,10
600,Questions exist concerning seasonal variation in these excisions.,19
601,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether AMPs are removed more often during the spring-summer seasons than in the fall-winter and whether the percentage of benign nevi, dysplastic nevi and melanoma varies according to season.",18
602,DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of 4794 histologically confirmed biopsies of AMPs was performed.,17
603,RESULTS: A total of 2802 of the 4794 lesions (58%) were removed during the spring-summer season.,18
604,"These results confirm that seasonal variation in removal of AMPs does occur, and that removal peaks during the warmer months.",18
605,"In addition, the increased numbers of removals were accounted for by increases in benign pigmented lesion removals.",18
606,CONCLUSIONS: Many etiologic factors can be suggested for increased removal of AMPs during the warmer months.,15
607,Reasons may include the cosmetic desires of the patient and clothing choices resulting in increased awareness of pigmented lesions.,11
608,Increases in the number of skin cancer prevention programs offered by dermatologists in the spring also have a large impact on the awareness of the general population and potentially contribute to the seasonal variation.,4
609,The diagnosis of mast cell lesions of the skin can occasionally be challenging.,18
610,"Calretinin, a 29 kD neuron-specific calcium-binding protein found mostly in the CNS and retina, has been shown to be a positive marker for mesotheliomas, and is also expressed in mast cells.",10
611,"We studied the diagnostic value of calretinin and compared our results to other established ancillary studies used to identify mast cells, such as Toluidine blue and the Leder stain.",18
612,"Sixty-three cases were studied, including 45 mast cell lesions (22 urticaria pigmentosum, 17 mastocytomas, and six telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans [TMEP]), seven nevi, three melanomas, four granular cell minors of the skin, three cutaneous lymphomas, and one granulocytic sarcoma.",10
613,Patients ranged in age from less than 1 to 85 years with a median age of 29 years.,11
614,The group consisted of 36 females and 27 males.,11
615,Calretinin was expressed in all 45 mast cell lesions.,18
616,"Negative staining for calretinin was seen in all skin lesions that potentially could be considered in the differential diagnosis of mast cell lesions such as nevi, melanomas, lymphomas, and the granulocytic sarcoma.",18
617,"However, calretinin expression was noted in four/four granular cell tumors.",18
618,"Leder and Toluidine blue stains were positive in all 45 mast cell lesions, and all nonmast cell lesions were negative with these stains.",18
619,"In conclusion, our study demonstrated that calretinin is a sensitive and specific marker of mast cells and can be an aid in distinguishing mast cell lesions from other skin lesions considered in the differential diagnosis.",18
620,Calretinin may be more sensitive than the currently used special stains utilized to diagnose mast cell lesions having few diagnostic mast cells such as TMEP.,18
621,"However, this immunoperoxidase stain does not add significant diagnostic information in most cases, when compared with the currently used less expensive special stains and, therefore, is not cost-effective.",3
622,BACKGROUND: Immunofluorescence findings in granuloma faciale have been infrequently described.,18
623,"Reported findings include granular IgA, IgG, IgM, and C3 deposits in the dermoepidermal junction, in blood vessel walls, and on connective tissue fibers; IgG in the basement membrane zone, and IgG around blood vessels.",0
624,OBSERVATIONS: We report two cases of granuloma faciale in which biopsy specimens were sent for routine pathology as well as immunofluorescence.,10
625,Additional work-up included serologic testing for markers of lupus erythematosus (LE).,18
626,"Immunofluorescence in both cases revealed granular IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, and C5-9 deposits along the dermoepidermal junction only.",18
627,Blood vessel walls and connective tissue fibers were spared.,0
628,Serologic studies for markers of LE were negative.,18
629,"CONCLUSION: Immunofluorescence findings were essentially identical to those which would be expected in cutaneous LE; however, the combination of negative serologic studies for LE, histopathologic findings typical of granuloma faciale, and clinical findings most consistent with granuloma faciale allowed the diagnosis of granuloma faciale to be rendered with certainty.",18
630,"Interpretation of results of direct immunofluorescence of skin should be correlated with clinical presentation, histopathological findings and other laboratory results in order to render final diagnosis of a given patient.",18
631,"The majority of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients respond satisfactorily to gentle bathing, frequent moisturizing, and topical medications.",5
632,Second-line therapies for AD should be used in recalcitrant cases or in patients with uncontrolled disease despite compliance with first-line measures and avoidance of allergens.,5
633,"Recommended advanced therapies include phototherapy, especially narrowband ultraviolet B, systemic immunosuppressants, and a new biologic agent.",5
634,"Few studies have compared head-to-head efficacy of the different immunosuppressant therapies such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil.",5
635,"Therefore, the agent used is based on provider and patient preferences and can be decided on a case-by-case basis.",5
636,BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Clinical trials of dupilumab have shown efficacy in treating moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in adult patients.,7
637,"While a phase 2 trial of dupilumab has shown efficacy and safety in children, the medication awaits Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, and off-label use is limited by dosing currently available to adults.",19
638,We present this case series to describe the efficacy and safety profile of off-label dupilumab use in six pediatric patients treated by one provider in a private practice.,7
639,METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients under the age of 18 receiving dupilumab for AD.,17
640,Two dosing regimens were used as follows: adult dose for patients â‰¥ 40Â kg and half dose for those < 40Â kg.,6
641,We recorded the investigator's global assessment (IGA) and body surface area (BSA) prior to dupilumab initiation and following treatment.,17
642,"All patients were warned of potential side effects including injection site reaction, conjunctivitis, increased risk of infection, and lack of information about use in children.",16
643,RESULTS: Six pediatric patients were identified with an average age of 10.8Â years (range: 7-15).,11
644,All patients had a decrease in IGA of at least 2 points using biweekly 300 or 150Â milligram (mg) doses for an average treatment duration of 8.5Â months (range: 6-11).,7
645,Three patients (50%) had an IGA of 1 after treatment.,18
646,No side effects were reported.,16
647,CONCLUSIONS: Dupilumab appears to be an effective treatment for AD in pediatric patients.,7
648,Optimal dose and delivery have yet to be determined.,6
649,"Therapeutic patient education (TPE) has proven effective in increasing treatment adherence and improving quality of life (QoL) for patients with numerous chronic diseases, especially atopic dermatitis (AD).",7
650,This study was undertaken to identify worldwide TPE experiences in AD treatment.,17
651,"Experts from 23 hospitals, located in 11 countries, responded to a questionnaire on 10 major items.",17
652,Patients in TPE programs were mainly children and adolescents with moderate to severe AD or markedly affected QoL.,17
653,Individual and collective approaches were used.,17
654,"Depending on the center, the number of sessions varied from one to six (corresponding to 2 to 12Â hours of education), and 20 to 200 patients were followed each year.",17
655,"Each center's education team comprised multidisciplinary professionals (e.g., doctors, nurses, psychologists).",17
656,"Evaluations were based on clinical assessment, QoL, a satisfaction index, or some combination of the three.",17
657,"When funding was obtained, it came from regional health authorities (France), insurance companies (Germany), donations (United States), or pharmaceutical firms (Japan, Italy).",3
658,"The role of patient associations was always highlighted, but their involvement in the TPE process varied from one country to another.",17
659,"Despite the nonexhaustive approach, our findings demonstrate the increasing interest in TPE for managing individuals with AD.",4
660,"In spite of the cultural and financial differences between countries, there is a consensus among experts to integrate education into the treatment of eczema.",4
661,"OBJECTIVES: Various treatment options are available for the management of rosacea symptoms such as facial erythema, telangiectasia, papules and pustules, burning, stinging, and itching.",5
662,Botanical therapies are commonly used to treat the symptoms.,5
663,The objective of this review is to evaluate the use of polyphenols in rosacea treatment.,8
664,"DESIGN: PubMed, Embase, Biosis, Web of Knowledge, and Scopus databases were systematically searched for clinical studies evaluating polyphenols in the management of rosacea.",17
665,"RESULTS: Of 814 citations, 6 met the inclusion criteria.",17
666,"The studies evaluated licochalcone (nâ€‰=â€‰2), silymarin (nâ€‰=â€‰2), Crysanthellum indicum extract (nâ€‰=â€‰1), and quassia extract (nâ€‰=â€‰1).",17
667,The studies only evaluated topical formations of stated polyphenols.,17
668,Main results were summarized.,17
669,CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that polyphenols may be beneficial for the treatment of rosacea symptoms.,5
670,Polyphenols appear to be most effective at reducing facial erythema and papule and pustule counts.,7
671,"However, studies included have significant methodological limitations and therefore large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are warranted to further assess the efficacy and safety of polyphenols in the treatment of rosacea.",17
672,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus colonization of healthcare workers is reported at 30%, with colonization rates for methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) reported between 2.0% and 8.5% among industrialized nations.",10
673,The anterior nares are the most frequent colonization site.,0
674,"Mupirocin is the standard of care for nasal S aureus decolonization, with decolonization rates as high as 90%.",5
675,"Staphyloccocal resistance to mupirocin has been described, requiring additional management strategies.",5
676,"In certain situations, triple antibiotic ointment (TAO) may be a suitable alternative for elimination of nasal S aureus colonization.",5
677,OBSERVATIONS: Adult healthcare workers within an academic-centered hospital (n=216) were screened via nasal swab with culture for S aureus colonization.,17
678,"Forty-!ve subjects (20.8%) screened positive for S aureus; of these subjects, 3 (1.4%) were positive for MRSA.",17
679,"Of the 45 subjects with positive cultures, 30 completed 5 days of twice-daily intranasal TAO application.",6
680,"One week after treatment, all 30 subjects were reswabbed; 16 (53.3%) showed evidence of decolonization on repeat culture.",7
681,CONCLUSIONS: The rate of S aureus colonization of healthcare workers in our study is lower than published rates in industrialized nations.,10
682,Intranasal application of TAO may be a viable option for eradication of nasal colonization by methicillin-susceptible S aureus in environments where mupirocin-resistant bacterial strains become more prevalent.,5
683,Importance: Clinical trials of dupilumab for atopic dermatitis (AD) have reported an increased incidence of conjunctivitis in patients who received dupilumab compared with those who received placebo.,16
684,Objective: To describe the characteristics of patients who develop conjunctivitis secondary to dupilumab treatment for AD.,11
685,"Design, Setting, and Participants: Case series of 12 patients who reported development of conjunctivitis from a cohort of 142 patients treated with dupilumab for AD at a secondary care center from March 14, 2017, to March 29, 2018.",17
686,Exposures: Patients received a 600-mg injection of dupilumab as a loading dose and a 300-mg injection every 2 weeks thereafter.,6
687,"Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome measures were severity of AD as measured by the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score, a 5-point scale from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), at the time of dupilumab initiation and at conjunctivitis onset.",18
688,"Results: Of the 12 patients included in this series, 7 (58%) were male.",11
689,The mean (SD) age of patients was 30 (8.1) years at the time conjunctivitis developed.,11
690,"All patients showed improvement of their AD at the time of conjunctivitis diagnosis, with a mean (SD) 1.9 (0.8)-point decrease in IGA score and 47.8% (11.2%) decrease in body surface area affected.",7
691,Nine of the 12 patients (75%) had severe baseline AD with an IGA score of 4.,16
692,All patients who discontinued treatment had severe AD at the time of initial dupilumab administration and had at least 1 atopic condition in addition to AD.,16
693,Conclusions and Relevance: Conjunctivitis that develops after administration of dupilumab to treat AD may be severe enough to necessitate stopping therapy.,16
694,Severe conjunctivitis was more likely to develop in patients with more severe baseline AD who had a good response to dupilumab and an increased atopic phenotype.,11
695,Studies are needed to confirm risk factors associated with development of conjunctivitis and to determine effective treatment.,19
696,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a complex condition that results from the dynamic interplay between genetic predisposition, skin barrier defects, environmental factors, and a dysfunctional immune system.",10
697,"As a result, AD can be complicated by irritant and allergic contact dermatitis and imbalances in the skin microbiome, which can subsequently exacerbate the severity and complicate the course of preexisting atopic disease.",15
698,"Itch is an important symptom of AD, as it plays a large role in the quality of life of patients and their families.",18
699,"Since AD is a chronic, inflammatory disease that recrudesces throughout life, many have utilized alternative and/or complementary therapies, as monotherapy or in conjunction with conventional therapies, as a form of management.",5
700,"Head-and-neck dermatitis is a variant of atopic dermatitis (AD) often seen in children and is challenging to diagnose, as it frequently overlaps with other eczematous dermatoses.",10
701,"Successful head-and-neck dermatitis (HND) treatment requires identification of common triggers and clinical mimickers, such as airborne dermatitis, periorificial dermatitis, and steroid-induced rosacea.",5
702,"Head-and-neck involvement negatively impacts quality of life and is often harder to treat than other body parts, as long-term topical corticosteroid use carries higher risks for skin atrophy on the face.",16
703,Heating and flushing associated with HND further exacerbate the itch-and-scratch-cycle and disrupt sleep.,10
704,"We aim to address diagnostic gaps, identify clinical mimickers, and share clinical pearls in managing HND, including cooling pillows, thermal water sprays, rice starch paper facial masks, and tips to minimize food and saliva-induced facial irritation.",5
705,Atopic dermatitis is a common skin disease characterized by eczematous eruptions and impaired skin barrier function.,10
706,"Patients, as well as their families, frequently report reductions in quality of life.",10
707,"Pruritus, lack of sleep, and impaired social functioning all contribute to this reduction.",15
708,A skincare regimen of gentle cleansing and daily moisturization is integral to managing atopic dermatitis.,5
709,"While there are a multitude of reports supporting the use of moisturizers, there is a paucity regarding the use of cleansers, especially cleansers formulated with ingredients known to improve skin hydration.",19
710,A clinical study was conducted to assess the tolerability and cosmetic acceptability of a body wash formulated with the filaggrin break-down products arginine and pyrrolidone carboxylic acid in subjects with atopic dermatitis-prone skin (CetaphilÂ® RestoraDermÂ® Body Wash).,16
711,"The results of this study indicate that Cetaphil RestoraDerm Body Wash was well tolerated, reduced itch, improved quality of life, and was well-liked by subjects with atopic dermatitis-prone skin.",7
712,"Throughout history, individuals have had a myriad of dermatologic conditions characterized as chronic pruritic dermatoses.",10
713,The term atopic dermatitis was not coined until the early 20th century.,10
714,Many diseases typical of this condition were reported using a variety of eponyms and descriptive terms.,10
715,"Even as the incidence of atopic dermatitis rises, it remains poorly understood in the modern era, and viewing the disease from a historical perspective provides useful insight into its nature.",10
716,This article highlights the evolution of concepts related to the pathogenesis of and recommended treatments for atopic dermatitis.,5
717,"Decreased systemic toxicity, ease of application, and increased concentration at the target site are some of the important advantages topical antibacterial agents offer.",16
718,This article reviews the literature on selected indications of these agents and provides in-depth examination of specific agents for the prophylaxis and treatment of skin and wound infections.,5
719,"OBJECTIVE: To quantify and compare the physiochemical properties of various topical emollients and to correlate these findings with the products' potential to maintain the stratum corneum (SC) acid milieu, while possessing the appropriate water content for skin rehydration, user adherence, and comfort.",12
720,MATERIAL AND METHODS: The pH and hydrophilic fraction of 31 skin moisturizers sold in the US were measured.,12
721,"Hydrophilic Index (HI) was calculated using the ""HI equation.""",17
722,The two parameters were charted using a scatter plot with quadrant divisions.,17
723,"Products with lower hydrophilicity were considered ""more greasy"" and assigned a lower HI as compared to their counterparts with a higher hydrophilicity.",12
724,"RESULTS: Our findings are in good accordance with common clinical impressions: lotions generally have higher HI, while ointments have lower HI.",2
725,"The majority of the products tested fall into low HI, suggesting that a large percentage of the products may be rich in overall lipid content.",12
726,"The pH values range widely, from 3.7 to 8.2, with the majority of the products close to the physiologic skin pH of 4 to 6.",12
727,CONCLUSION: This study introduces HI as a novel method of quantifying the aqueous content of topical emollients.,17
728,"When considered together with pH, the two indices can guide providers in choosing the most suitable emollients for patients with skin diseases involving altered acid mantle and barrier disruption, such as atopic dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis, and ichthyosis vulgaris.",5
729,"Atopic dermatitis, perhaps more than other dermatologic diseases, has garnered much attention in the realm of alternative medicine.",5
730,"This may be because its etiopathogenesis is incompletely understood, it is increasingly common, and it waxes and wanes often without clear precipitants, opening up many opportunities for misinterpretation.",10
731,"Herein we explore the evidence for a number of different alternative and complementary therapies, from textiles to vitamin supplements.",5
732,"By definition, none have enough data to be deemed ""effective"" in a conventional sense, but it is hopeful that some show promising evidence that may one day lead to mainstream acceptance with further research.",19
733,Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic pruritic inflammatory skin disease in which management with topical anti-inflammatory agents during exacerbations remains the mainstay of treatment.,5
734,"With no cure in sight, a significant proportion of patients elect to incorporate complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as an adjunct to conventional treatment.",19
735,"Many clinicians find it difficult to provide recommendations as the field covers an extensive number of very disparate therapies, with limited quality evidence to indicate efficacy.",5
736,"Since publication of the last review on this topic in theÂ JournalÂ that compiled and analyzed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on CAMs in 2015, several new studies have surfaced.",17
737,"A literature search was conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Global Resource for EczemA Trials (GREAT) databases for RCTs on complementary and alternative therapies in AD from March 2015 through May 2018, resulting in 15 studies being included in this review.",17
738,"The preliminary results for many treatments such as vitamin E, East Indian Sandalwood Oil (EISO), melatonin, L-histidine, and Manuka honey show positive clinical effects, but there is currently not enough evidence to recommend their use in AD therapy.",19
739,"Future investigative efforts should focus on reproducing some of these studies with a larger sample size whose clinical characteristics and demographics are more reflective of the general AD population, and standardizing the process to produce reliable data.",19
740,Fred Wise (1881-1950) and Marion Sulzberger (1895-1983) are often credited with introducing the term atopic dermatitis to dermatology in 1933.,10
741,"This definition was based on atopy, a term first created by Arthur Coca (1875-1959) and Robert Cooke (1880-1960) in 1923, when they recognized an association between allergic rhinitis and asthma.",10
742,"Despite its recent introduction into our medical lexicon, historical precursors of atopic dermatitis date back to at least as early as 69-140 ce.",10
743,"In this contribution, we highlight both the prominent individuals credited with shaping the disorder into our current interpretation and the suspected historical precursors of this disease and reported treatments.",10
744,"IMPORTANCE: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common skin condition treated by dermatologists, allergists, pediatricians, and primary care physicians.",5
745,Several treatment guidelines and therapeutic parameters exist for the management of this disease.,5
746,Health care professionals may be unaware of guidelines created by specialty organizations other than their own.,5
747,"OBJECTIVE: To review, compare, and contrast the most recent AD management guidelines.",5
748,"EVIDENCE REVIEW: The guidelines for AD management published by the American Academy of Dermatology 2014 work group were compared with those created by the 2012 Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters representing the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology; the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology; and the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.",17
749,International guidelines created by the 2012 European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis and the 2013 Asia-Pacific Consensus Group for Atopic Dermatitis were also considered.,17
750,FINDINGS: Several differences among the guidelines suggest that there may be disparity in the perceptions of AD between US dermatologists and allergists and health care professionals in other areas of the world.,5
751,"There are notable differences among the guidelines regarding the recommendations for the use of diluted bleach baths, vitamin D, and environmental modifications.",5
752,CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Comparison of different guidelines may ultimately augment knowledge of treatment strategies and enhance realization of biases in the understanding and management of AD.,5
753,"Atopic dermatitis is the most common chronic skin disease, and it primarily affects children.",10
754,"Although atopic dermatitis (AD) has the highest effect on burden of skin disease, no high-level studies have defined optimal therapy for severe disease.",19
755,"Corticosteroids have been used to treat AD since the 1950s and remain the only systemic medication with Food and Drug Administration approval for this indication in children, despite published guidelines of care that recommend against this option.",8
756,"Several clinical trials with level 1 evidence have supported the use of topical treatments for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in adults and children, but these trials have had little consistency in protocol design.",5
757,Consensus recommendations will help standardize clinical development and trial design for children.,17
758,"The Food and Drug Administration issues guidance documents for industry as a source for ""the Agency's current thinking on a particular subject.""",5
759,"Although they are nonbinding, industry considers these documents to be the standard for clinical development and trial design.",19
760,Our consensus group is the first to specifically address clinical trial design in this population.,17
761,"We developed a draft guidance document for industry, Developing Drugs for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis in Children (â‰¥3 months to <18 years of age).",5
762,This draft guidance has been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration based on a provision in the Federal Register (Good Guidance Practices).,17
763,"BACKGROUND: Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) and psoriasis are inflammatory disorders that share interferon-Î± induced responses and dysregulation of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha.",10
764,Although 13% of patients with JDM have a family history of psoriasis there is little information concerning children with JDM and psoriasis.,11
765,OBSERVATIONS: We identified 3 children with both JDM and psoriasis.,11
766,"In 2 cases, psoriatic lesions occurred after the child's JDM symptoms had diminished following effective immunosuppressive therapy (high-dose intermittent intravenous methylprednisolone, methotrexate, and low dose oral corticosteroids).",7
767,"Patient 2, initially diagnosed as having psoriasis, was treated with prednisone and methotrexate but then developed classic JDM, which worsened following use of tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor and reduction of prednisone and methotrexate dosage.",16
768,"For each child, their history of JDM complicated the choice of therapy for psoriasis.",10
769,CONCLUSIONS: Two therapies commonly used to treat psoriasis-phototherapy and tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists-must be used with caution in patients with both JDM and psoriasis owing to their potential to exacerbate clinical manifestations of JDM.,16
770,We discuss the implications affecting treatment of children with these dual diagnoses and consider the pathophysiology linking these 2 conditions.,5
771,"Poor adherence is frequent in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), leading to therapeutic failure.",7
772,Therapeutic patient education (TPE) helps patients with chronic disease to acquire or maintain the skills they need to manage their chronic disease.,4
773,"After a review of the literature, a group of multispecialty physicians, nurses, psychologists, and patients worked together during two international workshops to develop common recommendations for TPE in AD.",4
774,These recommendations were structured as answers to nine frequently asked questions about TPE in AD: What is TPE and what are its underlying principles?,17
775,Why use TPE in the management of AD?,5
776,Who should benefit from TPE in AD?,4
777,How can TPE be organized for AD?,5

780,Who are the people involved in TPE?,4
781,How should TPE be funded in dermatology?,4
782,What are the limits of the TPE process?,4
783,BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by intense pruritus that causes significant disease and psychosocial burden in patients.,10
784,Patient education has the potential to improve clinical outcomes and patient knowledge of this condition.,4
785,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess the effectiveness of online video education at improving AD knowledge and disease severity compared with a written pamphlet, and to determine the usefulness and appeal of the two educational delivery vehicles.",4
786,"METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, 80 participants were randomized to receive either online video-based patient education or written pamphlet education about AD and its management.",11
787,We assessed AD disease severity using the patient-oriented eczema measure (POEM) scale.,18
788,AD knowledge was assessed with standardized questionnaires at baseline and after the 12-week intervention.,17
789,RESULTS: All participants had similar baseline knowledge and AD severity at the beginning of the study.,17
790,"On study completion, improvements in AD knowledge assessed by questionnaire were significantly greater in the video group than the pamphlet group (3.05 vs 1.85, P = .011).",2
791,"Online video-based education resulted in greater improvement in clinical outcome, as measured by POEM, compared with pamphlet-based education (POEM score reduction of 3.30 vs 1.03, P = .0043).",7
792,"Finally, although the usefulness of both interventions was rated equally (P = .77), the online video was significantly more appealing than the pamphlet (P = .0086).",2
793,LIMITATIONS: This study is limited to AD in adults.,17
794,CONCLUSION: Online video for patient education is an effective and appealing tool for improving clinical outcomes in adult patients with AD.,4
795,"BACKGROUND: The National Eczema Association has received increasing numbers of patient inquiries regarding ""steroid addiction syndrome,"" coinciding with the growing presence of social media dedicated to this topic.",16
796,"Although many of the side effects of topical corticosteroids (TCS) are addressed in guidelines, TCS addiction is not.",16
797,OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the current evidence regarding addiction/withdrawal.,16
798,METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the current literature.,17
799,RESULTS: Our initial search yielded 294 results with 34 studies meeting inclusion criteria.,17
800,TCS withdrawal was reported mostly on the face and genital area (99.3%) of women (81.0%) primarily in the setting of long-term inappropriate use of potent TCS.,16
801,Burning and stinging were the most frequently reported symptoms (65.5%) with erythema being the most common sign (92.3%).,18
802,"TCS withdrawal syndrome can be divided into papulopustular and erythematoedematous subtypes, with the latter presenting with more burning and edema.",18
803,"LIMITATIONS: Low quality of evidence, variability in the extent of data, and the lack of studies with rigorous steroid addiction methodology are limitations.",17
804,CONCLUSIONS: TCS withdrawal is likely a distinct clinical adverse effect of TCS misuse.,16
805,Patients and providers should be aware of its clinical presentation and risk factors.,10
806,BACKGROUND: Pruritus is a debilitating aspect of atopic dermatitis (AD).,10
807,"Acupuncture has been reported to diminish pruritus, but self-administered acupressure has not been previously evaluated.",5
808,OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of acupressure on the severity of eczema in a pilot trial.,5
809,METHODS: Adult patients with AD were randomised to an intervention group (acupressure with standard of care) or a control group (standard of care alone).,17
810,"Subjects in the intervention group performed acupressure using a 1.2 mm acupellet at the LI11 point, applying pressure for 3 min three times per week for 4 weeks.",5
811,"The severity of itching and AD at baseline and at 4 weeks were measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS), the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) and the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI).",18
812,"RESULTS: Fifteen subjects were enrolled, 12 of whom completed the study between November 2009 and May 2011.",17
813,There was no significant change between baseline and follow-up survey scores within the control group.,17
814,"In the investigation group there was a decrease in the VAS score (p=0.05) and EASI lichenification (p=0.03), although without significant change in the overall EASI score.",7
815,"Comparison of the scores between groups showed a greater decrease in VAS in the experimental group than in the control group (p=0.04), and a decrease in the IGA (p=0.03) and EASI lichenification score (p=0.03).",2
816,The overall EASI scores were unchanged.,7
817,CONCLUSION: Subjects using acupressure at LI11 for 4 weeks had improvement in pruritus and lichenification.,7
818,"Acupressure may prove to be an easily administered alternative treatment, but larger-scale studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.",5
819,"Dermatologists frequently employ combination therapy to treat various diseases, but the evidence to support the use of such combinations is often lacking.",5
820,Synergy is an appealing although somewhat ambiguous concept in medicine.,12
821,"Utilizing synergy allows clinicians to provide the most efficacious combination of treatments to patients, while potentially minimizing adverse effects and reducing the development of drug resistance.",7
822,"Definitions of synergy vary, but ultimately converge on finding a therapeutic advantage in combining treatments.",5
823,"Here we discuss the concept of 'therapeutic synergy', which can be defined as an increase in the efficacy of a combination of treatments in comparison to any of its individual parts alone.",7
824,"We review the concept of therapeutic synergy in dermatology by discussing some of the evidence regarding combination therapies utilized in the management of atopic dermatitis, acne vulgaris, psoriasis, and cutaneous lupus erythematosus.",5
825,Further meaningful investigation of therapeutic synergy and its applications in dermatology should be undertaken.,5
826,BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Diet is a common concern for individuals with atopic dermatitis (AD) and their families.,10
827,"Studies regarding the effect of dietary interventions on AD exist, but many are limited by small size and poor design.",19
828,Conflicting results present a challenge to clinicians seeking to counsel patients.,19
829,The aim of the current review is to examine the published literature and generate helpful conclusions for clinicians faced with dietary questions in AD.,13
830,METHODS: A PubMed search was performed focusing on dietary interventions for AD in children and adults through July 2016.,17
831,The search was limited to the English language and included studies that evaluated one or more forms of dietary modification for the treatment of AD.,17
832,"Studies of supplementation, such as with vitamins, minerals, or probiotics, were not included, nor were studies on prevention of the development of AD.",17
833,A total of 43 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis.,17
834,"RESULTS: Trials varied in type, duration, and the AD patient populations studied.",17
835,"Overall, there is some level I evidence to support specific exclusion diets in preselected patients but insufficient evidence for strict elimination diets (diets that are typically limited to six to eight foods).",19
836,"Data supporting other interventions are mixed and based on small, poorly designed studies.",17
837,CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive literature review reveals some promising results and several areas in need of further study.,17
838,"More evidence is needed to form a strong foundation for recommendations regarding the utility and role of elimination diets in AD management, but current evidence suggests that strict diet management is not effective in the treatment AD in the vast majority of patients.",5
839,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) continues to present significant therapeutic challenges, especially in severe cases.",5
840,"Navigating the line between risk and benefit can be difficult for more powerful medications such as immunosuppressants, but non-pharmacologic treatments are often overlooked and underutilized.",7
841,"Creative application of these more physical therapies can serve to minimize the pharmacologic treatments and their side effects, and possibly even create synergy between modalities, to maximize benefit to the patient.",5
842,INTRODUCTION: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by impaired epidermal barrier with increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL).,10
843,"Scratching further compromises skin integrity, contributing to a cycle of inflammation.",10
844,The objective of the present study was to investigate a topical anti-itch foam in improving skin barrier and itch.,5
845,MATERIAL AND METHODS: A single center open study was performed on 26 adults previously diagnosed with AD but without active lesions.,17
846,One leg was treated with a single application of an anti-itch foam.,5
847,"Dryness, scaling, roughness, cracking, and signs of scratching were assessed before, 6, and 24 hours after application.",18
848,Skin hydration was measured at 24 hours.,17
849,"The same product was applied twice daily for 7.5 days to the other leg, and skin hydration and TEWL were measured at baseline and on days 2, 8, and 10.",17
850,Pruritus was assessed by volunteers and by a dermatologist.,18
851,RESULTS: A significant increase in skin moisture (P less than 0.001) was measured 6 hours after a single application.,7
852,"Scores of dryness, scaling, roughness (P less than 0.001) and cracking (P=0.002) were significantly improved up to 24 hours after a single application.",7
853,"After a 7.5-day repeated application period, the anti-itch foam significantly reduced TEWL (P less than 0.001) compared to baseline.",7
854,Skin hydration significantly improved (P less than 0.001) in the same time period.,7
855,"48 hours after the last application, these improvements remained significant (P less than 0.001).",7
856,CONCLUSIONS: The anti-itch foam improved the skin barrier.,7
857,It provided immediate relief of clinical signs of AD including pruritus.,7
858,"Moreover, it delivered a long-lasting moisturizing effect, comforting the skin, and improving overall skin condition.",7
859,"Cytokine dermatitis is a well-known and common clinical adverse effect of imiquimod 5% cream (Aldara, 3M).",16
860,"Data from initial Phase III clinical trials reveal a minority of study drug patients experience systemic adverse effects, including fever, arthralgia, headache, myalgia, and lymphadenopathy.",16
861,"These adverse effects are caused, presumably, from increased absorption of study drug over the area of dermatitis, leading to systemic cytokine release.",12
862,"Furthermore, the incidence of systemic reactions was rarely statistically increased above control patients.",16
863,We describe herein a case of severe cytokine dermatitis in a 2-year-old female patient treated with daily imiquimod for molluscum contagiosum who subsequently developed febrile seizure.,10
864,"We believe this to be the first reported case of seizure associated with imiquimod 5% cream (Aldara, 3M) in a pediatric setting.",16
865,"Decreased systemic toxicity, ease of application, and increased concentrations at the target site are some of the important advantages topical antibacterial agents offer.",16
866,This article reviews the literature on selected indications for these agents and provides in-depth examination of specific agents for the prophylaxis and treatment of skin and wound infections.,5
867,"OBJECTIVE: The International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria constitute the current international diagnostic standard for juvenile psoriatic arthritis (PsA), replacing the less-restrictive Vancouver criteria.",18
868,The impact of this change on the population diagnosed with juvenile PsA is unknown.,19
869,"METHODS: We reviewed the records of patients seen in a pediatric rheumatology clinic with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis codes for psoriasis, PsA, or spondylarthritis.",10
870,Characteristics of children who met the Vancouver and ILAR criteria were compared.,17
871,"RESULTS: Of 139 children meeting the Vancouver criteria for juvenile PsA, ILAR criteria excluded 80 (58%).",17
872,"Grounds for exclusion were insufficiently definitive rash (44%), a competing diagnosis of enthesitis-related arthritis (23%), family history of psoriasis limited to second-degree relatives (16%), fulfillment of criteria for >1 subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (5%), and HLA-B27 in a male with arthritis onset after age 6 (2%).",17
873,Remaining patients were not homogeneous but could be divided into younger and older subpopulations differing in clinical features as described previously among patients identified under the Vancouver standard.,17
874,"Of excluded patients, 76% were reclassified as having other forms of JIA yet were phenotypically comparable with those retained.",18
875,"CONCLUSION: Despite apparently modest changes from previous criteria, ILAR definitions strikingly restrict the diagnosis of PsA in childhood.",17
876,Similarity between excluded and included patients suggests that these restrictions may not reflect substantive clinical differences.,17
877,"To the extent that excluded patients become reclassified within JIA, current criteria risk compromising other ILAR categories while reducing the number of patients available for the study of juvenile PsA.",17
878,"Importance: Emerging evidence suggests that the use of moisturizers on newborns and infants (ie, from birth to 6 months of age) is potentially helpful in preventing the development of atopic dermatitis.",5
879,Objective: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of using a daily moisturizer as prevention against atopic dermatitis among high-risk newborns.,3
880,"Design, Setting, and Participants: In a cost-effectiveness analysis, the average cost of total-body moisturization using 7 common moisturizers from birth to 6 months of age was determined for male and female infants.",17
881,We assumed the same unit of weight per moisturizer used for a given body surface area.,17
882,"Based on previously reported data (relative risk reduction of 50%), the incremental gain in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was determined using a 6-month time window.",17
883,The cost-effectiveness of each moisturizer was determined by assuming equal efficacy.,7
884,A sensitivity analysis was conducted by varying the relative risk from 0.28 to 0.90.,17
885,Interventions: Use of prophylactic moisturizing compounds.,17
886,Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were the incremental cost-effectiveness values ($/QALY) for each moisturizer in preventing atopic dermatitis during a 6-month time window.,3
887,"Results: The calculated amount of daily all-body moisturizer needed at birth was 3.6 g (0.12 oz) per application, which increased to 6.6 g (0.22 oz) at 6 months of age.",6
888,"Of the 7 products evaluated, the average price was $1.07/oz (range, $0.13/oz-$2.96/oz).",3
889,"For a 6-month time window, the average incremental QALY benefit was 0.021.",7
890,The sensitivity analysis showed that the incremental gain of QALY ranged from 0.0041 to 0.030.,7
891,"Petrolatum was the most cost-effective ($353/QALY [95% CI, $244-$1769/QALY) moisturizer in the cohort.",3
892,"Even assuming the lowest incremental QALYs for the most expensive moisturizer, the intervention was still less than $45â€¯000/QALY.",3
893,"Conclusions and Relevance: Overall, atopic dermatitis represents a major health expenditure and has been associated with multiple comorbidities.",10
894,"Daily moisturization may represent a cost-effective, preventative strategy to reduce the burden of atopic dermatitis.",3
895,"Decreased systemic toxicity, ease of application, and increased concentrations at the target site are some of the important advantages topical antibacterial agents offer.",16
896,This article reviews the literature on selected indications for these agents and provides in-depth examination of specific agents for the prophylaxis and treatment of skin and wound infections.,5
897,Atopic dermatitis (AD) pathogenesis is strongly influenced by Type 2 innate lymphoid cell and T-helper cell type 2 lymphocyte-driven inflammation and skin barrier dysfunction.,10
898,"AD therapies attempt to correct this pathology, and guidelines suggest suggest basics of AD therapy, which include repair of the skin barrier through bathing practices and moisturizers, infection control, and further lifestyle modifications to avoid and reduce AD triggers.",5
899,"While some patients' AD may be controlled using these measures, inflammatory eczema including acute flares and maintenance therapy in more severe patients are treated with topical pharmacologic agents such as topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, and, more recently, topical PDE-4 inhibitors.",5
900,"This model of basic skin therapy and, as needed, topical pharmacologic agents may be used to treat the vast majority of patients with AD and remains the staple of AD therapy.",5
901,Mole removal creams available over the Internet pose potential dangers to unsuspecting patients.,16
902,We report a case of keloid development following the application of such a product.,16
903,Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disease that chronically affects children and adults worldwide.,10
904,"Environmental exposures, heritable factors, immune dysregulation, and skin barrier malfunction all contribute to the multifactorial nature of AD.",10
905,It is known that maternal and paternal influences are important predictors for the risk of AD in offspring.,15
906,This review examines and compares the evidence and mechanisms behind specific maternal and paternal factors that may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD.,10
907,"This parameter was developed by the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters, representing the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI); the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI); and the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.",17
908,"The AAAAI and the ACAAI have jointly accepted responsibility for establishing ""Atopic dermatitis: a practice parameter update 2012.""",5
909,"The medical environment is a changing environment, and not all recommendations will be appropriate for all patients.",5
910,These parameters are not designed for use by pharmaceutical companies in drug promotion.,18
911,Published practice parameters of the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters for Allergy & Immunology are available online at http://www.jcaai.org.,13
912,BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative interventions are becoming increasingly utilized as adjuncts to conventional treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD).,5
913,"While the number of studies continues to grow, the vastness of the subject coupled with the relatively poor quality and small size of the studies limit their usefulness to clinicians.",19
914,PURPOSE: Our aim was to comprehensively review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of complementary and alternative therapies for AD.,17
915,"METHODS: Searches were performed on PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, and the Global Resource for EczemA Trial (GREAT) databases, focusing on RCTs of alternative or complementary AD therapies, with a sample size of â‰¥10, through March 2015 and limited to the English language.",17
916,A total of 70 manuscripts met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis.,17
917,"RESULTS: There is at least some levelÂ I evidence to support the use of acupuncture and acupressure, stress-reducing techniques such as hypnosis, massage, and biofeedback, balneotherapy, herbal preparations (with many important caveats), certain botanical oils, oral evening primrose oil, vitamin D supplementation, and topical vitamin B.",5
918,"Many other therapies either have sufficient data to suggest that they are ineffective, or simply do not have enough evidence to formulate a verdict.",5
919,CONCLUSIONS: Careful review of the literature reveals several promising therapies in this domain; such findings may help direct further research that is necessary to bolster clinical recommendations for alternative or complementary treatments of AD.,5
920,The development of effective systemic treatments has revolutionized the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases.,5
921,The availability of safe new treatments and the understanding of psoriasis as a systemic disease with comorbidities and effects on quality of life have driven the current aggressive treatment paradigm of psoriasis.,10
922,"Historically the morbidity of atopic dermatitis (AD) has been dismissed, given the perception of AD as ""just"" a rash.",10
923,Differences in the guidelines for psoriasis and AD management may suggest variations in the current conceptualization of disease severity and effects on quality of life.,5
924,Published guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatology for the management of psoriasis and AD were reviewed.,5
925,We recorded the similarities and differences in disease assessment and therapy.,5
926,The threshold to use biologic agents for moderate to severe psoriasis highlights the aggressive nature of modern psoriasis treatment.,5
927,AD guidelines include an assessment of quality of life but do not designate a disease severity threshold for systemic treatment.,10
928,AD and psoriasis have a tremendous effect on quality of life.,10
929,The AD guidelines have a less aggressive approach to disease management than the psoriasis guidelines.,2
930,"We should think critically about rapid advancement to systemic agents in AD management, especially now that more and better agents are being developed.",5
931,Sensitive skin is a common skin complaint frequently associated with skin diseases or adverse reactions to cosmetic products.,18
932,Manufacturers have produced numerous products targeted for patients with sensitive skin and frequently label these products as being hypoallergenic.,5
933,This term implies that the product may be less likely to cause an allergic reaction and be better suited for those with sensitive skin.,16
934,"However, there is no federal regulatory definition of this term and products may not have clinical support of their claim.",19
935,"Patch testing ingredients is frequently done to identify potential irritants; however, patch-testing product formulations may provide more realistic expectations about potential skin sensitivity and help support claims of hypoallergenicity.",16
936,"Ten skincare products were assessed for their sensitizing potential and hypoallergenicity in 14 repeat insult patch test clinical studies, involving over 2,000 subjects.",17
937,"In these studies, the products were deemed to be hypoallergenic if there was no evidence of sensitization or allergic reactions.",16
938,"The results from these trials demonstrated that all ten products were well tolerated, showed no sensitization or allergic reactions, and support claims of hypoallergenicity.",16
939,A number of cutaneous disorders have been associated with underlying malignancies.,10
940,"This article reviews the clinical and histologic features of paraneoplastic disorders with cutaneous findings, discusses their associations with neoplastic and other related conditions, and recommends appropriate evaluation in this setting.",18
941,A heightened awareness of these conditions may facilitate the diagnosis of malignancy.,18
942,Atopic dermatitis is a challenging condition for clinicians and patients.,10
943,"Recent advances were documented in the Atopic Dermatitis Practice Parameter 2012, and we want to provide clinicians with key points from the Atopic Dermatitis Practice Parameter 2012.",13
944,"In this article, we highlight the evidence-based therapy of atopic dermatitis as well as provide practical tips for clinicians and families.",5
945,An updated review of immunopathology provides a firm basis for patient education and therapy.,5
946,We also review clinical diagnosis and ways to improve quality of life for patients with atopic dermatitis.,5
947,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have demonstrated that the use of a topical antimicrobial combined with a steroid may benefit patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), but modern guidelines discourage the use of antimicrobials in treating this condition.",5
948,"We sought to evaluate the degree of improvement in the severity and extent of AD lesions after using a compounded antibacterial, steroid, and moisturizer (CASM).",5
949,METHODS: This was a nonblinded retrospective review of patients with AD treated using CASM.,17
950,"Multiple patients in the study had previously failed mid- or higher-potency topical steroids, systemic immunosuppressives, or phototherapy (standard therapy [ST] group).",16
951,"Patients were assessed at baseline and at one follow-up visit, with an average follow-up period of 49.5Â days.",17
952,We included all patients with AD in the database who were prescribed CASM and had one subsequent follow-up appointment.,5
953,We excluded patients who had newly started a systemic immunosuppressant or phototherapy at the time of beginning CASM.,17
954,RESULTS: We included 116 patients in the study.,17
955,We observed a decrease in mean severity of 1.4 points on a 6-point scale and an average decrease in body surface area (BSA) affected of 23.2Â Â±Â 2.5% overall and a decrease in mean severity of 1.4 points and average decrease in BSA affected of 19.7Â Â±Â 2.8% in the ST group.,7
956,CONCLUSION: CASM appears to be effective in the management of AD and mayÂ offer additional benefit for patients who have plateaued with standard therapies.,7
957,Life-threatening dermatologic conditions do not always present with classic findings.,10
958,This review--and the accompanying images--will help you recognize and respond to them without delay.,13
959,The objective of this study was to describe the clinical features of Sweet syndrome in children.,18
960,Our study population consisted of seven children diagnosed with Sweet syndrome over a 22-year period.,11
961,"Age, sex, appearance and location of lesions, associated signs and symptoms, past medical history, pathology, and subsequent disease course were documented for each patient.",18
962,Fever and typical lesions were reported in most of patients in our study.,18
963,"The majority of patients presented with less-typical findings, such as pustules, vesicles, bullae, oral ulcerations, atrophic scars, and evidence of pathergy.",18
964,"Of the seven children in our study, four were found to have a preceding nonspecific upper respiratory or gastrointestinal infection, and two were diagnosed with an underlying hematologic malignancy.",10
965,Our results suggest that atypical lesions are relatively common in children with Sweet syndrome and that underlying malignancy is associated with a minority of cases of pediatric Sweet syndrome.,10
966,"Sudoriferous glands, also known as sweat glands, are either of two types of secretory skin glands, eccrine or apocrine.",0
967,Eccrine and apocrine glands reside within the dermis and consist of secretory cells and a central lumen into which material is secreted.,0
968,"Typically, eccrine glands open directly onto the skin surface whereas apocrine glands open onto associated hair follicles.",0
969,"As such, eccrine glands can be found almost anywhere on the human body, with the highest concentration found on the palms and soles.",0
970,"Apocrine glands are found in more restricted areas of the body including the axilla, anogenital region, external ear canal, and areola.",0
971,"Eccrine glands consist of a tube-shaped duct that ends in a coiled, secretory unit.",0
972,This secretory unit is made up of cuboidal cells that surround a central lumen.,0
973,Myoepithelial cells form around the cuboidal cells and contract in response to stimuli to assist with secretion.,0
974,Apocrine glands have a similar structure to eccrine glands but have a larger secretory component that is lined by either cuboidal or columnar epithelium and associated myoepithelial cells.,0
975,BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a potent tumour suppressor gene that modulates environmental carcinogenesis.,10
976,"All carriers of inherited heterozygous germline BAP1-inactivating mutations (BAP1) developed one and often several BAP1 malignancies in their lifetime, mostly malignant mesothelioma, uveal melanoma, and so on.",10
977,"Moreover, BAP1-acquired biallelic mutations are frequent in human cancers.",10
978,"BAP1 tumour suppressor activity has been attributed to its nuclear localization, where it helps to maintain genome integrity.",10
979,The possible activity of BAP1 in the cytoplasm is unknown.,10
980,"Cells with reduced levels of BAP1 exhibit chromosomal abnormalities and decreased DNA repair by homologous recombination, indicating that BAP1 dosage is critical.",10
981,Cells with extensive DNA damage should die and not grow into malignancies.,10
982,Here we discover that BAP1 localizes at the endoplasmic reticulum.,10
983,"Here, it binds, deubiquitylates, and stabilizes type 3 inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R3), modulating calcium (Ca) release from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol and mitochondria, promoting apoptosis.",12
984,"Reduced levels of BAP1 in BAP1 carriers cause reduction both of IP3R3 levels and of Ca flux, preventing BAP1 cells that accumulate DNA damage from executing apoptosis.",14
985,"A higher fraction of cells exposed to either ionizing or ultraviolet radiation, or to asbestos, survive genotoxic stress, resulting in a higher rate of cellular transformation.",10
986,We propose that the high incidence of cancers in BAP1 carriers results from the combined reduced nuclear and cytoplasmic activities of BAP1.,10
987,Our data provide a mechanistic rationale for the powerful ability of BAP1 to regulate gene-environment interaction in human carcinogenesis.,10
988,"GBCCs are rare, tend to be multiple, often develop in sun-protected areas, usually occur in Caucasians without a family history of skin cancer, and have no clear association with immunological or psychiatric factors.",10
989,Fear may be the underlying factor leading to neglect and chronicity of the tumors.,15
990,We report the case of a 63-year-old obese man with a rapid-onset of widespread acanthosis nigricans (AN) in the setting of having recently initiated treatment with niacin for dyslipidemia.,16
991,"Although obesity and insulin-resistance are risk factors for AN, AN associated with endocrine dysfunction tends to have a more gradual onset and limited involvement.",10
992,"Owing to our patient's age, the rapid onset, and extensive distribution of his eruption, we initially were concerned about paraneoplastic AN.",10
993,"However, an evaluation for a malignant condition was negative.",10
994,The timing of the onset of our patient's eruption within several months of starting niacin therapy is consistent with niacin-induced AN.,16
995,"Niacin is known to cause rapidly progressive, widespread AN that is reversible upon discontinuation of the medication.",16
996,"We discuss the pathogenesis of AN, which is thought to be the final common manifestation of stimulation of different subtypes of tyrosine kinase receptors by various epidermal growth factors.",10
997,"We report a 52-year-old man with a one-year history of multiple, firm, skin-colored nodules on the vertex of the scalp.",11
998,"Histopathologic examination was consistent with a spiradenoma, which is a rare, benign adnexal tumor of controversial histogenesis.",18
999,"Multiple spiradenomas may arise in association with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, which is an autosomal dominant condition of multiple cyclindromas, trichoeptheliomas, and cyclindromas.",10
1000,"We present a case of cutaneous sarcoidosis in a 77-year-old woman without systemic disease, who presented with two subtypes of lesions: erythematous and hyperpigmented macules on the arms and anterior upper legs and erythematous, hyperkeratotic nodules, some crateriform, on the lower legs and feet.",10
1001,"Whereas cutaneous sarcoidosis is present in up to one-third of cases and may present with a wide variety of lesions, verrucous sarcoidosis is uncommon.",10
1002,"Diagnosis is by clinical and histopathologic exclusion of other entities, which include other causes of granulomatous inflammation such as infections and foreign-body reactions.",18
1003,"Management options include topical, intralesional, or systemic glucocorticoids, antimalarials, tetracycline derivatives, and methotrexate.",5
1004,"We present a case of acrokeratosis verruciformis of Hopf in a 58-year-old woman with multiple, skin-colored, flat-topped, hyperkeratotic papules on the dorsal aspects of the hands and feet.",18
1005,Her lesions appeared at age 13 and her son developed similar lesions at about the same age.,10
1006,"Acrokeratosis verruciformis of Hopf is a rare genodermatosis, which is distinct from keratosis follicularis; sporadic cases have also been described.",10
1007,"Management options include cryotherapy, keratolytics, superficial ablation with CO2 or Nd:YAG lasers, topical retinoids, and acitretin.",5
1008,"Generalized essential telangiectasia, which is a rare condition that is characterized by the progressive development of telangiectases on the skin, is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion.",10
1009,We present a 65-year-old man with a ten-month history of an asymptomatic eruption of the trunk and proximal aspects of the arms and hands that was comprised of macules and patches of telangiectases.,11
1010,"The clinical presentation, associated diseases, hypotheses regarding pathogenesis, differential diagnoses, and reports on treatment modalities are reviewed.",17
1011,The relatively new association of this entity with systemic signs that include hemorrhage as well as the occurrence of generalized essential telangiectasia in patients with a history of hepatitis is discussed.,10
1012,Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a vascular neoplasm associated with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) infection that can be confused with the clinical and histological findings of chronic venous insufficiency.,10
1013,Definitive diagnosis of KS can only be achieved by performing a polymerase chain reaction for HHV-8 or by immunostaining for the HHV-8 antigen.,18
1014,We describe 2 unusual clinical presentations of KS in the setting of chronic venous insufficiency with clinical and histologic features consistent with stasis dermatitis but positive HHV-8 immunostaining.,18
1015,Both patients had no known risk factors for KS.,15
1016,We propose the possibility that these cases may represent a new clinical variant of KS that may become more prevalent over time.,10
1017,Further studies are needed to identify the risk factors involved.,19
1018,"Meanwhile, skin biopsy with HHV-8 testing may be warranted for violaceous patches and plaques arising on the legs in the setting of chronic venous insufficiency, especially in patients who are unresponsive to treatment.",10
1019,"We present a 40-year-old man with erythematous-to-violaceous, broken, reticulated patches on the upper chest, back, and extremities, which is consistent with livedo racemosa.",11
1020,The cutaneous findings appeared after an increase in dilantin dose and subsequently improved after a reduction in dilantin dose.,16
1021,"Furthermore, antinuclear antibodies and antihistone antibodies were detected.",18
1022,We therefore believe that the livedo racemosa is a cutaneous manifestation of a drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus.,16
1023,We review the distinctive features of livedo racemosa as well as its associations with several disorders.,17
1024,"Although there are no effective treatments for livedo racemosa, patients often are placed on low-dose aspirin and counseled to avoid smoking in an effort to protect against their increased risk of stroke and arterial thrombosis.",5
1025,A patient with widely metastatic papillary thyroid cancer who had been previously treated with (131)I and external beam radiation presented with purple nodular lesions on his face and scalp.,16
1026,"On biopsy, the nodules were papillary carcinoma with cells that stained for thyroglobulin.",18
1027,"Subsequently he developed decreased left eye visual acuity, and fundoscopy revealed lesions typical of choroidal metastases.",16
1028,Dermal and choroidal metastases of papillary thyroid carcinoma are both rare.,10
1029,"However, the significance of these clinical manifestations may be overlooked and ignored unless the diagnosis is considered.",18
1030,New skin nodules or visual acuity decline in a patient with papillary thyroid cancer may represent manifestations of distant metastatic disease and should prompt thorough evaluation with dermatological examination and fundoscopy.,18
1031,"Choroidal and skin metastases have almost always occurred in patients with advanced disease, but initial presentation with these lesions is possible, and in such instances a thorough search for additional sites of metastatic disease is recommended.",18
1032,Occasionally such metastases may respond to (131)I therapy or external beam radiation.,5
1033,"BACKGROUND: Narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) therapy has been used successfully for the treatment of inflammatory and pigmentary skin disorders including atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, mycosis fungoides, polymorphous light eruption, and vitiligo.",5
1034,"METHODS: This is a retrospective review of the treatment outcomes of 117 consecutive patients with vitiligo, pruritus, and other inflammatory dermatoses, excluding those with psoriasis and CTCL, who were treated with NB-UVB between 1998 and 2001 at our institution.",17

1071,"Criteria for diagnosis of amyopathic dermatomyositis vary, and the prognosis is not clear.",18
1072,Our purpose was to investigate prognosis regarding progression to myositis and associated malignancy.,17
1073,We reviewed the medical records of patients with dermatomyositis evaluated at our institution from 1976 to 1994.,17
1074,"Of 746 patients with dermatomyositis, 37 (5%) with the amyopathic subtype were divided into 3 groups: group 1 (73%), no subjective or objective evidence of myopathy; group 2 (13%), no subjective muscle weakness but abnormalities detected by objective tests; group 3 (13%), subjective muscle weakness but no objective evidence of myopathy.",17
1075,Follow-up was conducted by means of a mailed questionnaire.,17
1076,"For 25 patients, follow-up of 1 to 17 years after diagnosis showed muscle weakness in 2 patients in group 1 within 5 years after diagnosis.",18
1077,Five patients (13%) had associated malignancies.,11
1078,"Of 7 (19%) patients with disease onset before the age of 18 years, none had progression to myopathy.",11
1079,"Although it presents with cutaneous lesions indistinguishable from those of classic dermatomyositis, amyopathic dermatomyositis is a distinct entity.",18
1080,"In most patients, amyopathic dermatomyositis does not progress to myopathy.",10
1081,"Prognosis appears favorable, but malignancy may develop.",10
1082,"A comprehensive transient model of chemical penetration through the stratum corneum, viable epidermis and dermis formulated in terms of an Excelâ„¢ spreadsheet and associated add-in is presented.",9
1083,The model is a one-dimensional homogenization of underlying microscopic transport models for stratum corneum and dermis; viable epidermis is treated as unperfused dermis.,9
1084,"The model's salient features are a detailed structural description of the skin layers, a combination of first-principles based transport equations and empirical partition and diffusion coefficients, and the capability of simulating a variety of exposure scenarios.",0
1085,"Model predictions are compared with representative in vitro skin permeation data obtained from the literature using as summary parameters total absorption (Q(abs)), maximum flux (J(max)) and skin permeability coefficient (k(p)).",9
1086,The results of this evaluation demonstrate the current state-of-the-art in prediction of transient skin absorption and highlight areas in which further elaborations are needed to obtain satisfactory predictions.,12
1087,A spreadsheet-based computer program has been developed to address the problem of simultaneous absorption and evaporation from a multicomponent formulation applied to the skin so that the disposition of each ingredient is tracked.,12
1088,The mass and thickness of the formulation layer (or vehicle) change with time as its components disperse.,9
1089,The presence of each component on the surface of the skin generally affects the activity of the other components at the surface.,12
1090,"Thermodynamic activities within the vehicle are governed by either a modified ideal solution model or the UNIversal QUAsiChemical approximation (UNIQUAC) functional group activity coefficient method/UNIQUAC model, at the user's discretion.",9
1091,Program-calculated or experimental solubility limits for the component of greatest interest may be invoked.,19
1092,The predictions of the multicomponent vehicle (MCV) model were compared with human in vitro skin permeation data drawn from an earlier report.,9
1093,Absorption of small to moderate doses of vanillylnonamide from a propylene glycol vehicle was predicted significantly better with the MCV model than with simpler models that track only one component.,2
1094,Repair of scalp defects with exposed calvaria remains a difficult clinical problem.,5
1095,"Herein, we present a simple alternative method of scalp reconstruction.",5
1096,"Coverage of bare skull with GammaGraft (Promethean LifeSciences, Inc, Pittsburgh, PA) promotes the evolution of granulation tissue and permits subsequent skin grafting without need for burring, drilling, or other manipulation of the outer table of the calvaria.",12
1097,A retrospective review of patients undergoing scalp reconstruction utilizing GammaGraft and subsequent skin grafting was performed at our institution.,17
1098,"From our cohort, 5 patients treated with GammaGraft and subsequent skin grafting had both immediate and long-term follow-up available.",11
1099,Indications for scalp reconstruction included erosions of prior skin grafts and direct excision of full-thickness scalp and pericranium.,8
1100,Average time to definitive skin grafting was 3 weeks; repeat application of GammaGraft was required in some patients with reapplication to subsequent smaller wounds as healing occurred.,5
1101,Complications were minor and consisted of ongoing wound drainage.,16
1102,Alternative flap reconstruction was not required in any patient due to treatment failures.,16
1103,"No major complications, wound infections, or early reoperations occurred in any of the patients; 1 patient to date has required repeat reconstruction due to recurrent disease.",16
1104,Coverage of bare skull with GammaGraft and subsequent skin grafting provides a simple and elegant solution to an often too difficult clinical problem.,5
1105,"Confirmed by results in out limited series, the utilization of GammaGraft in calvarial reconstruction represents an alternative method in surgical care of complex scalp defects with exposed bone.",5
1106,"Human skin absorption of radiolabeled parathion was studied in vitro at specific doses (mass loadings) of 0.4, 4.0, 41, or 117 microg/cm(2), with and without occlusion.",6
1107,The compound was applied in small volumes of acetone solution to split-thickness skin.,6
1108,"Permeation of radiolabel into the receptor solutions was monitored for 76 h, after which the tissue was dissected and analyzed for residual radioactivity.",12
1109,"For the 3 lower doses, cumulative permeation after 76 h was approximately dose-proportional, ranging from 28.5-30.5% of applied dose (unoccluded) to 45.5-55.7% (occluded).",6
1110,"Total absorption, calculated as receptor fluid plus dermis content, followed a similar pattern.",17
1111,"Both permeation rate and total absorption continued to increase up to the highest dose tested, consistent with results from other laboratories.",12
1112,"These results are compared with predictions from a previously developed skin diffusion model (Kasting et al., 2008a).",17
1113,"The model predicted total absorption to within a factor of 1.4 at 0.4 microg/cm(2) and 1.6 at 4 microg/cm(2), but substantially underpredicted absorption at the 2 higher doses.",12
1114,The analysis showed that parathion partitioned more favorably into the stratum corneum than the diffusion model prediction.,2
1115,"Nevertheless, comparison of the model predictions to a previously reported human study showed that the skin absorption model, when corrected for surface losses occurring in vivo, satisfactorily described in vivo dermal absorption of parathion applied at 4 microg/cm(2) to various body sites.",12
1116,"Mixed surfactant and surfactant-polymer compositions have been reported to decrease surfactant deposition onto and penetration into the skin relative to single surfactant compositions, potentially improving the mildness of the product.",7
1117,"Previous workers in this area [see Moore :29-46 (2003), and subsequent publications] employed a procedure in which excised porcine skin was exposed to a surfactant solution containing radiolabeled sodium dodecyl sulfate (C-SDS) for 5 h. We have developed an improved SDS penetration assay using excised human skin that reflects typical consumer exposure times for rinse-off products.",12
1118,"Using the new protocol, we were able to see a significant decrease in C-SDS penetration from a sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)/polyethylene oxide composition applied to excised skin for either 2 or 10 min, as compared to SLS only.",12
1119,"Furthermore, differences between the SDS penetration patterns on porcine skin and human skin were seen with a second SLS/polymer system; consequently, we do not recommend porcine skin for routine mildness screening by C-SDS penetration.",12
1120,Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) results in inflammation of the skin due to sensitization of the immunologic system to a particular substance.,10
1121,The sensitization process is limited by the compound's ability to both permeate and react with proteins in the integumentary system.,12
1122,"Currently, only in vivo animal tests such as the local lymph node assay (LLNA) are recognized by regulatory authorities for risk assessment of ACD.",18
1123,"A quantitative structure-activity relationship has been developed to predict relative potency, which allows for the prediction of relative sensitization potentials.",12
1124,The experimental values used in this study include EC3 values (the concentration at which the stimulation index equals 3) from LLNA tests.,17
1125,The predictions in this model enable categorization of the compounds into three groups on the basis of risk of sensitization and enable screening of candidate molecules using rapid SAM1 semiempirical calculations prior to animal testing.,17
1126,The model may also be used to reduce the number of animals subjected to testing by providing estimated concentrations required for useful data of risk assessment.,17
1127,The effect of averaging available literature values on predictive ability is also investigated.,17
1128,"The model includes halogenated compounds, aromatic compounds, alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones.",17
1129,The computational investigation resulted in a two-descriptor model that is consistent with the assumed mechanism for sensitization.,12
1130,A porous pathway feature has been added to an existing skin diffusion model to extend the range of applicability to highly polar solutes that do not readily diffuse across the stratum corneum (SC) lipid/corneocyte matrix.,12
1131,"The porous pathway consists of 2 components: Pathway A is appendageal and is implemented as an array of aqueous shunts (the macropores), which themselves have microporous walls with transient aqueous pores (the micropores).",12
1132,"Two varieties of shunts are discussed, one representing a terminal hair follicle and the other representing an eccrine sweat duct; however, the focus here is on the hair follicle.",17
1133,"Pathway B is transcellular, with lipid-phase transport accomplished through defects or breaks in the bilayer lipid structure.",12
1134,The composite model admits polar solutes into the skin in a size-selective manner with an effective micropore radius of 1.6 nm.,12
1135,"Steady-state permeabilities, desorption rates from isolated SC, and SC/water partition coefficients of both polar and lipophilic solutes are effectively explained.",12
1136,A diffusion model to account for the disposition of an arbitrary dose of a (potentially) volatile compound applied to skin from a volatile vehicle is presented.,17
1137,"In its most general form, the model allows for variable diffusivity of the permeant in the stratum corneum (SC) and must be solved numerically.",12
1138,"However, for permeants having a constant diffusivity, absorption, and evaporation is characterized in terms of four dimensionless parameters-a reduced time tau, a fractional deposition depth in the SC f, a ratio of membrane capacity for the permeant to the applied dose beta, and a ratio of evaporative mass transfer coefficient to diffusive permeability chi.",12
1139,An important combination of these parameters arises as the reduced dose M(r) = (fbeta)(-1).,6
1140,Two cases are distinguished.,17
1141,"In Case 1, corresponding to M(r) < or = 1, the dose is less than that required to saturate the upper layers of the SC, and the shape of the absorption and evaporation profiles is independent of the dose.",12
1142,Analytical solutions to Case 1 may be derived for arbitrary initial distributions of the permeant; the solution for a square wave is presented.,17
1143,"In Case 2, corresponding to M(r) > 1, absorption and evaporation approach steady-state values as the dose is increased.",12
1144,Numerical evaluations of this behavior are shown.,17
1145,Limiting behavior for the case of a highly volatile solvent applied to skin is discussed.,17
1146,A companion paper discusses the application of the model to the absorption and evaporation of benzyl alcohol from human skin in vitro.,17
1147,Importance: Reconstructing Mohs defects often requires grafting in the form of full-thickness skin grafts (FTSGs) and composite grafts.,5
1148,These grafts can be complicated by a variable and often indeterminable survival rate.,5
1149,"Other researchers have found that delaying FTSG reconstruction improves graft outcomes, but the optimal interval between excision and reconstruction remains unclear, and no study has examined the association between delaying composite graft reconstruction and graft survival.",19
1150,"Objective: To review the outcomes of Mohs micrographic surgery defect reconstruction using FTSG and composite grafts with respect to patient- and surgery-specific variables, particularly early vs delayed reconstruction.",17
1151,"Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective, single-institution cohort study assessed patients who underwent Mohs reconstructive surgery from January 1, 2012, to January 1, 2018.",17
1152,No patients had to be excluded for inadequate follow-up or incomplete medical records.,17
1153,"Delayed reconstruction was defined as greater than 6 days after Mohs excision, the third quartile of the interval to reconstruction among our cohort.",17
1154,"Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was postoperative complications, including hematoma, infection, dehiscence, epidermolysis, and partial or full graft loss.",16
1155,"Results: A total of 320 defects were reconstructed with FTSG or composite grafts in 310 patients (median [range] age, 68 [21-96] years; 167 female [53.9%]) during the 6-year study period.",11
1156,"The mean interval between the ablative and reconstructive operations was 4.73 days (range, 0-35 days).",17
1157,Univariate logistic regression was used to determine the significant indicators among patient and defect characteristics analyzed.,17
1158,"A multivariate logistic regression model found delayed reconstruction to have a protective association (odds ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.27-0.97; Pâ€‰=â€‰.046) and male sex to have a harmful association (odds ratio, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.52-4.20; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001) with postoperative complications.",16
1159,"Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that delaying reconstruction in FTSGs and composite grafts was associated with decreased rates of postoperative complications, and male sex was associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications.",16
1160,"The findings suggest that this strategy can be considered in patients at increased risk for developing postoperative complications, such as current smokers, patients with large defects, and patients who require use of composite grafts.",8
1161,Permeation of tecnazene into and through human cadaver skin in vitro was assessed using a CC-MS method employing HS-SPME for receptor solution analyses.,17
1162,"Two doses of tecnazene dissolved in acetone, corresponding to 103 and 864 microg/cm2 of tecnazene, were applied to skin mounted on Franz diffusion cells and placed in a fume hood.",6
1163,Cells were either occluded with aluminum foil or left unoccluded.,17
1164,Total absorption of tecnazene (dermis + receptor fluid) after 48 h was 2.2-6.1% of the applied dose for the unoccluded treatments and 22-33% for the occluded treatments.,12
1165,Potentially absorbed dose including all tecnazene that may have eventually permeated the skin ranged from 10% unoccluded to 42-53% occluded.,12
1166,Accumulation in the receptor solutions was satisfactorily described by a working diffusion model after upward adjustment of the partition coefficient for tecnazene in all skin layers by a factor of 5-16 versus a priori values.,12
1167,"However, residual amounts of tecnazene in both the epidermis and dermis were higher than those estimated from the model, suggesting the existence of tissue binding not accounted for in the calculation.",17
1168,"The results indicate that the diffusion model as presently calibrated may significantly underestimate both systemic absorption and skin concentrations of highly lipophilic compounds, as predicted from data generated from in vitro skin permeation assays.",12
1169,Model predictions could be improved by better accounting for partitioning into the epidermis and dermis.,12
1170,The penetration of DEET through split-thickness cadaver skin was measured in non-occluded Franz cells placed either in a fume hood or on a laboratory workbench.,12
1171,"DEET, dissolved in a small volume of ethanol and spiked with (14)C radiolabel was applied to skin at doses from 0.02 to 11000 microg/cm(2).",6
1172,"DEET penetration was greater for cells placed on the workbench, and the percentage of radioactivity penetrated after 72 h increased gradually with dose, for doses up to 680 microg/cm(2).",12
1173,"At higher doses, it declined.",6
1174,Percent penetration ranged from 11.5 +/- 3.2% for a dose of 0.021 microg/cm(2) in the fume hood to 71.9 +/- 5.5% for a dose of 260 microg/cm(2) on the workbench.,12
1175,"Results were interpreted in terms of a diffusion/evaporation model having three parameters-a solubility value for the chemical in the upper stratum corneum, M(sat); a mass transfer coefficient for evaporation, k(evap); and a characteristic time for diffusion, h(2)/D.",17
1176,The parameters obtained from fitting the model to the data (normalized to the fume hood environment) were M(sat) = 18 microg/cm(2) and k(evap) = 2.6 x 10(-5) cm/h.,12
1177,"The value of h(2)/D decreased from 16 h at a DEET dose of 25 microg/cm(2) to 10 h at 1480 microg/cm(2), consistent with an increase in skin permeability of about 1.5-fold over this dose range.",12
1178,This effect was confirmed by means of an additional study in which skin samples pretreated with increasing amounts of unlabeled DEET were washed and redosed with (14)C-benzyl alcohol.,17
1179,"A small (1.7-fold), but significant, increase in benzyl alcohol penetration with increasing amount of DEET was obtained.",12
1180,"Thus, DEET enhanced its own skin permeation rate as well as that of another compound, but the effect was modest and not likely to be a major concern for compounds coadministered with DEET.",7
1181,A method is presented for measuring the lateral diffusion coefficients of exogenously applied compounds on excised skin.,17
1182,The method involves sequential high resolution imaging of the spatial distribution of Î²-radiation associated with [(14)C]-labeled compounds to monitor the development of the concentration profile on the skin surface.,9
1183,"It is exemplified by measurements made on three radiolabeled test compounds--caffeine, testosterone, and zinc pyrithione (ZnPT)--administered as solutions.",17
1184,"Lateral diffusivity is expected to be an important determinant of the topical bioavailability of ZnPT, which is characteristically administered as a fine suspension and must reach microorganisms in molecular form to exert biocidal activity.",12
1185,Application of the test compounds at levels below and above their estimated saturation doses in the upper stratum corneum allows one to distinguish between diffusion-limited and dissolution rate-limited kinetics.,12
1186,"The effective lateral diffusivities of the two chemically stable reference compounds, caffeine and testosterone, were (1-4) Ã— 10(-9) cm(2)/s and (3-9) Ã— 10(-9) cm(2)/s, respectively.",12
1187,"Lateral transport of [(14)C] associated with ZnPT was formulation-dependent, with effective diffusivities of (1-2) Ã— 10(-9) cm(2)/s in water and (3-9) Ã— 10(-9) cm(2)/s in a 1% body wash solution.",12
1188,These differences are thought to be related to molecular speciation and/or the presence of a residual surfactant phase on the skin surface.,12
1189,All values were greater than those estimated for the transverse diffusivities of these compounds in stratum corneum by factors ranging from 250 to over 2000.,7
1190,"Facile lateral transport on skin, combined with a low transdermal permeation rate, may thus be seen to be a key factor in the safe and effective use of ZnPT as a topical antimicrobial agent.",12
1191,The penetration of benzyl alcohol (BA) through split-thickness cadaver skin was measured in nonoccluded Franz cells placed in a fume hood.,12
1192,"BA, dissolved in a small volume of ethanol and spiked with (14)C radiolabel, was applied to skin at nine doses ranging from 0.9 to 10600 microg/cm(2).",6
1193,"The percentage of radioactivity penetrated after 24 h increased gradually with dose, ranging from 19.8 +/- 2.9% at the lowest dose to 29.2 +/- 3.0% at the highest.",12
1194,Less than 4% of the radioactivity was retained in the tissue at 24 h; the remainder was considered to be evaporated.,12
1195,These data and those from a previous study were analyzed in terms of a finite dose diffusion/evaporation model.,17
1196,"The analysis showed that the increase in BA absorption with dose was consistent with a threefold increase in BA diffusivity in the stratum corneum, as its concentration increased from tracer levels to saturation.",12
1197,The variable diffusivity model was able to describe the combined observations from the two studies to within an rms error of 4.2% of dose.,17
1198,A method of estimating the diffusion model parameters independently of the experiment was found to yield good agreement with the experimentally-derived values at low and moderate doses.,17
1199,The specific evaporation rates of 21 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from either human skin or a glass substrate mounted in modified Franz diffusion cells were determined gravimetrically.,17
1200,"The diffusion cells were positioned either on a laboratory bench top or in a controlled position in a fume hood, simulating indoor and outdoor environments, respectively.",17
1201,A data set of 54 observations (34 skin and 20 glass) was assembled and subjected to a correlation analysis employing 5 evaporative mass transfer relationships drawn from the literature.,17
1202,were found to be the most effective at correlating observed and calculated evaporation rates under the various conditions.,17
1203,The U.S. EPA model was selected for further use based on its simplicity.,17
1204,This is a turbulent flow model based only on vapor pressure and molecular weight of the VOC and the effective air flow rate u. Optimum values of u for the two laboratory environments studied were 0.23 m s(-1) (bench top) and 0.92 m s(-1) (fume hood).,17
1205,"The partition coefficients (K(de)) and diffusivities (D(de)) of compounds in mammalian dermis were examined through an analysis of in vitro permeation data obtained from the literature combined with experimental results with the test permeant, (3)H-testosterone.",17
1206,"The literature data involved 26 compounds ranging in molecular weight from 18 to 476 Da and four species-human, guinea pig, rat and mouse.",17
1207,Testosterone was studied by permeation and desorption measurements employing excised human dermis in the presence and absence of external serum albumin.,17
1208,Mathematical models for both K(de) and D(de) were developed.,17
1209,"The K(de) model involved ionization, binding to extravascular serum proteins and partitioning into a small lipid compartment.",12
1210,The D(de) model employed a free diffusivity with a liquid-like size dependence multiplied by a binding factor derived from K(de).,17
1211,An additional analysis considered in vivo dermal concentration profiles of topically applied permeants.,17
1212,"Literature data for 5 of 6 permeants were shown to be well described by a previously published model for capillary clearance in the dermis, which leads to an exponential decay of concentration with depth.",17
1213,"Computed decay lengths (1/e values) ranged from 210 to 920 microm, and the corresponding clearance rate constants k(de) ranged from 0.9 x 10(-4) to 14 x 10(-4)s(-1) (n=8).",12
1214,Departures from the exponential decay profile are discussed in terms of non-uniform capillary clearance and incomplete attainment of a steady-state.,12
1215,"The disposition of N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET) applied to split-thickness human cadaver skin was measured in modified Franz cells maintained at 32 degrees C and fitted with a vapor trap.",17
1216,"Ethanolic solutions of DEET (1% w/w) spiked with (14)C radiolabel were applied to skin at a dose of 10 microL per cell, corresponding to a DEET dose of 127 microg/cm(2).",6
1217,Room air was drawn over the skin at velocities ranging from 10-100 mL/min.,17
1218,Evaporation of radiolabel from the skin surface and absorption into the receptor solution were monitored for 24 hr post-dose.,12
1219,"The percentage of radioactivity collected in the vapor trap after 24 hr increased with airflow, ranging from 16 +/- 4% at 10 mL/min to 59 +/- 7% at 70 mL/min.",7
1220,"The percentage of radioactivity absorbed through the skin after 24 hours decreased with increasing airflow, ranging from 69 +/- 7% at 10 mL/min to 20 +/- 1% at 80 mL/min.",7
1221,Tissue retention after 24 hr was 6-14% of the radioactive dose with no clear correlation to airflow.,12
1222,This data as well as DEET absorption data from two previous in vitro studies in which dose and location (fume hood or bench top) was varied were analyzed in terms of a recently developed diffusion/evaporation model for skin implemented on an Excel spreadsheet.,17
1223,A priori model calculations based on independently estimated transport parameters (Model 1) were compared with calculations based on fitted parameters (Models 2 and 3).,17
1224,"The analysis of the combined dataset (n = 272 observations) showed that the Model 1 estimates matched the cumulative disposition profiles to within a root mean square error of 12.4% of the applied dose (r(2) = 0.65), whereas the Model 2 and Model 3 fits matched to within 9.4% (r(2) = 0.80) and 6.5% (r(2) = 0.91), respectively.",17
1225,"The Model 3 fits were obtained using a concentration-dependent diffusivity of DEET in the stratum corneum, the value of which increased 3.4-fold between low concentrations and saturation.",17
1226,This result was consistent with the mild skin penetration enhancement effect for DEET reported elsewhere.,7
1227,OBJECTIVE: The results of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) can be useful for staging and deciding on adjuvant treatment for patients with head and neck melanoma.,5
1228,False-negative SLNB can result in treatment delay.,18
1229,This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics and outcome of patients with false-negative SLNB in cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck.,18
1230,STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study using a prospective institutional tumor registry.,17
1231,SETTING: Academic health center.,17
1232,SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Data from 153 patients who underwent SLNB for melanoma of the head and neck were analyzed.,17
1233,False-negative biopsy was defined as recurrence of tumor in a previously identified negative nodal basin.,18
1234,Statistical analysis was performed on registry data.,17
1235,RESULTS: Positive sentinel lymph nodes were identified in 19 (12.4%) patients.,18
1236,"False-negative SLNB was noted in 9 (5.9%) patients, with a false-negative SLNB rate of 32.1%.",18
1237,"Using multivariate regression analysis, only examination of a single sentinel lymph node was a significant predictor of false-negative SLNB (P = .01).",18
1238,The mean treatment delay for the false-negative SLNB group was 470 days compared with 23 days in the positive SLNB group (P < .001).,17
1239,"The 2-year overall survival of patients with false-negative SLNB was 75% compared with 84% and 98% in positive and negative SLNB groups, respectively (P = .02).",17
1240,CONCLUSIONS: False-negative SLNB is more likely to occur when a single sentinel lymph node is harvested.,18
1241,There is significant treatment delay in patients with false-negative SLNB.,5
1242,False-negative SLNB is associated with poor outcome in patients with melanoma of the head and neck.,18
1243,"Delusions of parasitosis (DOP) is a somatic subtype of delusional disorder, also known as monosymptomatic hypochondriacal psychosis.",10
1244,The management of DOP has been discussed extensively in the medical literature.,5
1245,"Patients with suspected DOP have a broad differential diagnosis, including skin-based or systemic medical conditions and several kinds of psychiatric disease.",18
1246,"However, there are many patients who have been labeled with DOP but do not meet the diagnostic criteria or who present with additional somatic complaints.",11
1247,These cases are a unique therapeutic challenge for dermatologists and psychiatrists alike and have not been thoroughly studied or reported.,19
1248,We present a patient referred for DOP who benefited substantially with antidepressant therapy.,11
1249,Lichen planopilaris (LPP) is a primary cicatricial alopecia that rarely presents in a linear distribution.,10
1250,We present a case of linear LPP that was isolated to the frontal scalp with extension down the forehead.,11
1251,"It is uncommon to see a linear distribution of LPP anywhere on the body, but it is particularly rare on the scalp.",10
1252,We also discuss the pathophysiology of disorders that present in unusual linear distributions.,10
1253,Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by venous and/or arterial thrombosis or recurrent fetal loss associated with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and/or a lupus anticoagulant.,10
1254,The skin appears to be an important target organ and many cases of APS may present with skin manifestations.,18
1255,"These lesions may be manifold and may take the form of livedo reticularis, livedo racemosa, ulcerations, digital gangrene, subungeal splinter hemorrhages, superficial venous thrombosis, thrombocytopenic purpura, pseudovasculitic manifestations, extensive cutaneous necrosis, or primary anetoderma.",10
1256,We report a case of fulminant APS-related cutaneous necrosis.,11
1257,"A 38-year-old Caucasian male with a past history of APS, multiple deep vein thrombi/pulmonary emboli, presented with necrotic lesions on his right upper and right lower extremities.",10
1258,"Initially, baseline anticoagulation was increased without improvement.",5
1259,"Subsequently, plasma exchange was initiated on a daily schedule.",5
1260,"Furthermore, rituximab 1,000 mg IV was administered on days 1 and 15.",6
1261,"After six consecutive daily sessions of plasma exchange, there was significant regression of the necrotic lesions.",7
1262,"After a 22-day hospital stay, the patient was discharged to home on fondaparinux.",5
1263,The patient presented approximately 2 months later after missing follow-up appointments.,11
1264,"At the time, his initial lesions looked remarkably improved.",7
1265,INTRODUCTION: Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a prototypic thrombotic microangiopathy attributable to complement dysregulation.,10
1266,"In the absence of complement inhibition, progressive clinical deterioration occurs.",10
1267,The authors postulated that a biopsy of normal skin could corroborate the diagnosis of aHUS through the demonstration of vascular deposits of C5b-9.,18
1268,MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biopsies of normal skin from 22 patients with and without aHUS were processed for routine light microscopy and immunofluorescent studies.,18
1269,An assessment was made for vascular C5b-9 deposition immunohistochemically and by immunofluorescence.,17
1270,The biopsies were obtained primarily from the forearm and/or deltoid.,18
1271,"RESULTS: Patients with classic features of aHUS showed insidious microvascular changes including loose luminal platelet thrombi, except in 2 patients in whom a striking thrombogenic vasculopathy was apparent in biopsied digital ulcers.",18
1272,"Extensive microvascular deposits of the membrane attack complex/C5b-9 were identified, excluding 1 patient in whom eculizumab was initiated before biopsy.",18
1273,"In 5 of the 7 patients where follow-up was available, the patients exhibited an excellent treatment response to eculizumab.",7
1274,"Patients without diagnostic clinical features of aHUS failed to show significant vascular deposits of complement, except 2 patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura including 1 in whom a Factor H mutation was identified.",18
1275,"CONCLUSIONS: In a clinical setting where aHUS is an important diagnostic consideration, extensive microvascular deposition of C5b-9 supports the diagnosis of either aHUS or a subset of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura patients with concomitant complement dysregulation; significant vascular C5b-9 deposition predicts clinical responsiveness to eculizumab.",18
1276,OBJECTIVE: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and scleroderma (SSc) are chronic rheumatic disorders with detrimental effects on health-related quality of life.,10
1277,Our objective was to assess health values (utilities) from the general public for health states common to people with PsA and SSc for economic evaluations.,3
1278,"METHODS: Adult subjects from the general population in a Midwestern city (N = 218) completed the SF-12 Health Survey and computer-assisted 0-100 rating scale (RS), time trade-off (TTO, range: 0.0-1.0) and standard gamble (SG, range: 0.0-1.0) utility assessments for several hypothetical PsA and SSc health states.",17
1279,"RESULTS: Subjects included 135 (62%) females, 143 (66%) Caucasians, and 62 (28%) African-Americans.",11
1280,"The mean (SD) scores for the SF-12 Physical Component Summary scale were 52.9 (8.3) and for the SF-12 Mental Component Summary scale were 49.0 (9.1), close to population norms.",17
1281,"The mean RS, TTO, and SG scores for PsA health states varied with severity, ranging from 20.2 to 63.7 (14.4-20.3) for the RS 0.29 to 0.78 (0.24-0.31) for the TTO, and 0.48 to 0.82 (0.24-0.34) for the SG.",17
1282,"The mean RS, TTO, and SG scores for SSc health states were 25.3-69.7 (15.2-16.3) for the RS, 0.36-0.80 (0.25-0.31) for the TTO, and 0.50-0.81 (0.26-0.32) for the SG, depending on disease severity.",17
1283,CONCLUSION: Health utilities for PsA and SSc health states as assessed from the general public reflect the severity of the diseases.,10
1284,These descriptive findings could have implications regarding comparative effectiveness research for tests and treatments for PsA and SSc.,5
1285,"OBJECTIVE: Assigning utilities to hypothetical health states requires that the health states be described in adequate detail, but there is no agreement on exactly how health states should be described.",19
1286,We assess utilities from the general public for health states common in scleroderma (SSc) by describing the health states in writing alone v. with photographs of patients with SSc.,17
1287,"METHODS: Subjects rated several SSc health states on a 0 to 100 rating scale (RS) and completed computer-assisted time tradeoff (TTO; range, 0.0-1.0) and standard gamble (SG; range, 0.0-1.0) assessments.",17
1288,"Half of the subjects were assigned to be shown photographs of patients with SSc health states in addition to written health state descriptions, whereas the other half were given only the written descriptions.",17
1289,"RESULTS: Of the 213 participants, 133 (62%) were female, 138 (65%) were Caucasian, and 62 (29%) were African American.",11
1290,"Median RS, TTO, and SG scores for 5 SSc health states ranged from 20 to 70, 0.28 to 0.94, and 0.50 to 0.90, respectively.",18
1291,"In bivariate analyses, showing pictures was associated with lower RS scores for 2 of 5 health states and lower SG values for all 5 health states (P < 0:05 for comparison of pictures v. no pictures), but with no difference in TTO values.",18
1292,"Multivariable analyses revealed negative associations between pictures and SG valuations for the 3 most severe SSc health states (R(2) range, 0.04-0.08).",18
1293,"CONCLUSION: Adding pictures of people with SSc to written health state descriptions can affect valuations of SSc health states, although the effect differs by valuation measurement method and by health state severity.",17
1294,Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is a rare disorder characterized by widespread human papillomavirus infection and malignant transformation.,10
1295,"EV may be caused by mutations of the genes EVER1 or EVER2, which are located on the EV1 locus, 17q25.",10
1296,We describe a patient with EV and a novel homozygous gene mutation of EVER2 gene who was treated successfully with topical imiquimod.,11
1297,OBJECTIVE: To determine factors related to residents' self-reported skill level for the skin cancer examination (SCE).,17
1298,DESIGN: Survey of residents in November 2003.,17
1299,SETTING: Four US residency programs.,17
1300,"PARTICIPANTS: Medical residents in family medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, and internal medicine and specialists.",17
1301,MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of residents reporting their current skill level for the performance of the SCE.,17
1302,"RESULTS: Of 454 surveys distributed, 342 residents completed the survey (75.3% response rate).",17
1303,Clinical training for the SCE during residency was infrequent.,13
1304,"During residency, 75.8% were never trained in the SCE, 55.3% never observed an SCE, and 57.4% never practiced the examination.",13
1305,Only 15.9% of residents reported being skilled in the SCE.,13
1306,"However, the conduct of 4 SCEs (or slightly more than 1 per each year of residency) was associated with manifold increases in self-reported skill levels.",13
1307,CONCLUSIONS: Information now collected from 7 medical schools and 4 residency programs underscores the need for more supervised opportunities to enable physicians in training to perform an SCE during routine patient examinations.,13
1308,Melanoma incidence is increasing among Hispanics/Latinos in California.,10
1309,This community-based project reached out to a rural Hispanic/Latino community in North San Diego County to provide melanoma prevention and screening education.,18
1310,"At a local community health fair, bilingual volunteer lay health workers led 10- to 15-minute-long information sessions on melanoma disease, risk factors, and skin self-examination techniques.",4
1311,"Pearson chi-square analyses of participants' (N = 34) responses to pre- and postintervention evaluation surveys indicate significant increases in knowledge, risk awareness, and self-efficacy for self-screening.",7
1312,The results revealed that Hispanics/Latinos in a low socioeconomic stratum might be at moderate to high risk for developing melanoma.,15
1313,"Their low annual income, low level of education, occupational sun-exposure, and lack of access to health care are likely factors that deter at-risk Hispanics/Latinos from seeking health care.",11
1314,Lichen planopilaris (LPP) is a primary cicatricial alopecia that rarely presents in a linear distribution.,10
1315,We present a case of linear LPP that was isolated to the frontal scalp with extension down the forehead.,11
1316,"It is uncommon to see a linear distribution of LPP anywhere on the body, but it is particularly rare on the scalp.",18
1317,We also discuss the pathophysiology of disorders that present in unusual linear distributions.,10
1318,"Ultraviolet radiation (UV) therapy is sometimes used as a treatment for various common skin conditions, including psoriasis, acne, and eczema.",5
1319,The dosage of UV light is prescribed according to an individual's skin sensitivity.,6
1320,"Thus, to establish the proper dosage of UV light to administer to a patient, the patient is sometimes screened to determine a minimal erythema dose (MED), which is the amount of UV radiation that will produce minimal erythema (sunburn or redness caused by engorgement of capillaries) of an individual's skin within a few hours following exposure.",6
1321,This article describes how to conduct minimal erythema dose (MED) testing.,13
1322,"There is currently no easy way to determine an appropriate UV dose for clinical or research purposes without conducting formal MED testing, requiring observation hours after testing, or informal trial and error testing with the risks of under- or over-dosing.",6
1323,"However, some alternative methods are discussed.",17
